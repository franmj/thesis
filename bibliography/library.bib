abstract = {A protein structure model generally needs to be evaluated to assess whether or not it has the correct fold. To improve fold assessment, four types of a residue-level statistical potential were optimized, including distance-dependent, contact, Phi/Psi dihedral angle, and accessible surface statistical potentials. Approximately 10,000 test models with the correct and incorrect folds were built by automated comparative modeling of protein sequences of known structure. The criterion used to discriminate between the correct and incorrect models was the Z-score of the model energy. The performance of a Z-score was determined as a function of many variables in the derivation and use of the corresponding statistical potential. The performance was measured by the fractions of the correctly and incorrectly assessed test models. The most discriminating combination of any one of the four tested potentials is the sum of the normalized distance-dependent and accessible surface potentials. The distance-dependent potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses both C(alpha) and C(beta) atoms as interaction centers, distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types, has the distance range of 30 A, and is derived and used by taking into account the sequence separation of the interacting atom pairs. The terms for the sequentially local interactions are significantly less informative than those for the sequentially nonlocal interactions. The accessible surface potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses C(beta) atoms as interaction centers and distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types. The performance of the tested statistical potentials is not likely to improve significantly with an increase in the number of known protein structures used in their derivation. The parameters of fold assessment whose optimal values vary significantly with model size include the size of the known protein structures used to derive the potential and the distance range of the accessible surface potential. Fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the very small models. This difficulty presents a challenge to fold assessment in large-scale comparative modeling, which produces many small and incomplete models. The results described in this study provide a basis for an optimal use of statistical potentials in fold assessment.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Elucidation of molecular targets of a compound [mode of action (MoA)] and its off-targets is a crucial step in drug development. We developed an online collaborative resource (MANTRA 2.0) that supports this process by exploiting similarities between drug-induced transcriptional profiles. Drugs are organized in a network of nodes (drugs) and edges (similarities) highlighting 'communities' of drugs sharing a similar MoA. A user can upload gene expression profiles before and after drug treatment in one or multiple cell types. An automated processing pipeline transforms the gene expression profiles into a unique drug 'node' embedded in the drug-network. Visual inspection of the neighbouring drugs and communities helps in revealing its MoA and to suggest new applications of known drugs (drug repurposing). MANTRA 2.0 allows storing and sharing user-generated network nodes, thus making MANTRA 2.0 a collaborative ever-growing resource.

abstract = {Knowledge and investigation of therapeutic targets (responsible for drug efficacy) and the targeted drugs facilitate target and drug discovery and validation. Therapeutic Target Database (TTD, http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/ttd/ttd.asp) has been developed to provide comprehensive information about efficacy targets and the corresponding approved, clinical trial and investigative drugs. Since its last update, major improvements and updates have been made to TTD. In addition to the significant increase of data content (from 1894 targets and 5028 drugs to 2025 targets and 17,816 drugs), we added target validation information (drug potency against target, effect against disease models and effect of target knockout, knockdown or genetic variations) for 932 targets, and 841 quantitative structure activity relationship models for active compounds of 228 chemical types against 121 targets. Moreover, we added the data from our previous drug studies including 3681 multi-target agents against 108 target pairs, 116 drug combinations with their synergistic, additive, antagonistic, potentiative or reductive mechanisms, 1427 natural product-derived approved, clinical trial and pre-clinical drugs and cross-links to the clinical trial information page in the ClinicalTrials.gov database for 770 clinical trial drugs. These updates are useful for facilitating target discovery and validation, drug lead discovery and optimization, and the development of multi-target drugs and drug combinations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The interaction between drugs and their targets, often proteins, and between antibodies and their targets is important for planning and analyzing investigational and therapeutic interventions in many biological systems. Although drug-target and antibody-target data sets are available in separate databases, they are not publically available in an integrated bioinformatics resource. As medical therapeutics, especially in cancer, increasingly uses targeted drugs and measures their effects on biomolecular profiles, there is an unmet need for a user-friendly toolset that allows researchers to comprehensively and conveniently access and query information about drugs, antibodies and their targets. SUMMARY: The PiHelper framework integrates human drug-target and antibody-target associations from publically available resources to help meet the needs of researchers in systems pharmacology, perturbation biology and proteomics. PiHelper has utilities to i) import drug- and antibody-target information; ii) search the associations either programmatically or through a web user interface (UI); iii) visualize the data interactively in a network; iv) export relationships for use in publications or other analysis tools.

abstract = {The inverse protein folding problem, the problem of finding which amino acid sequences fold into a known three-dimensional (3D) structure, can be effectively attacked by finding sequences that are most compatible with the environments of the residues in the 3D structure. The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.},

The DINIES server accepts any 'profiles' or precalculated similarity matrices (or 'kernels') of drugs and target proteins in tab-delimited file format. When a training data set is submitted to learn a predictive model, users can select either known interaction information in the KEGG DRUG database or their own interaction data. The user can also select an algorithm for supervised network inference, select various parameters in the method and specify weights for heterogeneous data integration. The server can provide integrative analyses with useful components in KEGG, such as biological pathways, functional hierarchy and human diseases.

abstract = {Chemical-genomic and genetic interaction profiling approaches are widely used to study mechanisms of drug action and resistance. However, there exist a number of scoring algorithms customized to different experimental assays, the relative performance of which remains poorly understood, especially with respect to different types of chemogenetic assays. Using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test bed, we carried out a systematic evaluation among the main drug target analysis approaches in terms of predicting global drug-target interaction networks. We found drastic differences in their performance across different chemical-genomic assay types, such as those based on heterozygous and homozygous diploid or haploid deletion mutant libraries. Moreover, a relatively small overlap in the predicted targets was observed between those approaches that use either chemical-genomic screening alone or combined with genetic interaction profiling. A rank-based integration of the complementary scoring approaches led to improved overall performance, demonstrating that genetic interaction profiling provides added information on drug target prediction. Optimal performance was achieved when focusing specifically on the negative tail of the genetic interactions, suggesting that combining synthetic lethal interactions with chemical-genetic interactions provides highest information on drug-target interactions. A network view of rapamycin-interacting genes, pathways and complexes was used as an example to demonstrate the benefits of such integrated and optimized analysis of chemogenetic assays in yeast.},

abstract = {Resistance to cancer therapies presents a significant clinical challenge. Recent studies have revealed intratumoral heterogeneity as a source of therapeutic resistance. However, it is unclear whether resistance is driven predominantly by pre-existing or de novo alterations, in part because of the resolution limits of next-generation sequencing. To address this, we developed a high-complexity barcode library, ClonTracer, which enables the high-resolution tracking of more than 1 million cancer cells under drug treatment. In two clinically relevant models, ClonTracer studies showed that the majority of resistant clones were part of small, pre-existing subpopulations that selectively escaped under therapeutic challenge. Moreover, the ClonTracer approach enabled quantitative assessment of the ability of combination treatments to suppress resistant clones. These findings suggest that resistant clones are present before treatment, which would make up-front therapeutic combinations that target non-overlapping resistance a preferred approach. Thus, ClonTracer barcoding may be a valuable tool for optimizing therapeutic regimens with the goal of curative combination therapies for cancer.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large sets of protein-ligand complexes efficiently is a key challenge in computational biomolecular science, with applications in drug discovery, chemical biology, and structural biology. Since a scoring function (SF) is used to score, rank, and identify drug leads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for a protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual screening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited ranking accuracy has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with a variety of physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. We assess the ranking accuracies of these new ML-based SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 and 2010 PDBbind benchmark data sets on both diverse and protein-family-specific test sets. We also investigate the influence of the size of the training data set and the type and number of features used on ranking accuracy. Within clusters of protein-ligand complexes with different ligands bound to the same target protein, we find that the best ML-based SF is able to rank the ligands correctly based on their experimentally determined binding affinities 62.5 percent of the time and identify the top binding ligand 78.1 percent of the time. For this SF, the Spearman correlation coefficient between ranks of ligands ordered by predicted and experimentally determined binding affinities is 0.771. Given the challenging nature of the ranking problem and that SFs are used to screen millions of ligands, this represents a significant improvement over the best conventional SF we studied, for which the corresponding ranking performance values are 57.8 percent, 73.4 percent, and 0.677.},

We report a computational approach that combines different sources of drug and protein interaction information to assemble the myocardial infarction drug-target interactome network (My-DTome). My-DTome comprises approved and other drugs interlinked in a single, highly-connected network with modular organization. We show that approved and other drugs may both be highly connected and represent network bottlenecks. This highlights influential roles for such drugs on seemingly unrelated targets and pathways via direct and indirect interactions. My-DTome modules are associated with relevant molecular processes and pathways. We find evidence that these modules may be regulated by microRNAs with potential therapeutic roles in MI. Different drugs can jointly impact a module. We provide systemic insights into cardiovascular effects of non-cardiovascular drugs. My-DTome provides the basis for an alternative approach to investigate new targets and multidrug treatment in MI.},

One algorithm is proposed in the paper. At each iteration, the decision maker is asked to give preference information in terms of his or her reference point consisting of desirable aspiration levels for objective functions. The information is used in an evolutionary algorithm to generate a new population by combining the fitness function and an achievement scalarizing function. In multi-objective optimization, achievement scalarizing functions are widely used to project a given reference point into the Pareto optimal set. In our approach, the next population is thus more concentrated in the area where more preferred alternatives are assumed to lie and the whole Pareto optimal set does not have to be generated with equal accuracy. The approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

abstract = {In recent years, although many ligand-binding site prediction methods have been developed, there has still been a great demand to improve the prediction accuracy and compare different prediction algorithms to evaluate their performances. In this work, in order to improve the performance of the protein-ligand binding site prediction method presented in our former study, a comparison of different binding site ranking lists was studied. Four kinds of properties, i.e., pocket size, distance from the protein centroid, sequence conservation and the number of hydrophobic residues, have been chosen as the corresponding ranking criterion respectively. Our studies show that the sequence conservation information helps to rank the real pockets with the most successful accuracy compared to others. At the same time, the pocket size and the distance of binding site from the protein centroid are also found to be helpful. In addition, a multi-view ranking aggregation method, which combines the information among those four properties, was further applied in our study. The results show that a better performance can be achieved by the aggregation of the complementary properties in the prediction of ligand-binding sites.},

abstract = {The molecular basis of drug action is often not well understood. This is partly because the very abundant and diverse information generated in the past decades on drugs is hidden in millions of medical articles or textbooks. Therefore, we developed a one-stop data warehouse, SuperTarget that integrates drug-related information about medical indication areas, adverse drug effects, drug metabolization, pathways and Gene Ontology terms of the target proteins. An easy-to-use query interface enables the user to pose complex queries, for example to find drugs that target a certain pathway, interacting drugs that are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 or drugs that target the same protein but are metabolized by different enzymes. Furthermore, we provide tools for 2D drug screening and sequence comparison of the targets. The database contains more than 2500 target proteins, which are annotated with about 7300 relations to 1500 drugs; the vast majority of entries have pointers to the respective literature source. A subset of these drugs has been annotated with additional binding information and indirect interactions and is available as a separate resource called Matador. SuperTarget and Matador are available at http://insilico.charite.de/supertarget and http://matador.embl.de.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Polypharmacology (the ability of a single drug to affect multiple targets) is a key feature that may explain part of the decreasing success of conventional drug discovery strategies driven by the quest for drugs to act selectively on a single target. Most drug targets are proteins that are composed of domains (their structural and functional building blocks).

RESULTS: In this work, we model drug-domain networks to explore the role of protein domains as drug targets and to explain drug polypharmacology in terms of the interactions between drugs and protein domains. We find that drugs are organized around a privileged set of druggable domains. Conclusions: Protein domains are a good proxy for drug targets, and drug polypharmacology emerges as a consequence of the multi-domain composition of proteins.

abstract = {In the past few years, network-based tools have become increasingly important in the identification of novel molecular targets for drug development. Systems-based approaches to predict signal transduction-related drug targets have developed into an especially promising field. Here, we summarize our studies, which indicate that modular bridges and overlaps of protein-protein interaction and signaling networks may be of key importance in future drug design. Intermodular nodes are very efficient in mediating the transmission of perturbations between signaling modules and are important in network cooperation. The analysis of stress-induced rearrangements of the yeast interactome by the ModuLand modularization algorithm indicated that components of modular overlap are key players in cellular adaptation to stress. Signaling crosstalk was much more pronounced in humans than in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster in the SignaLink (http://www.SignaLink.org) database, a uniformly curated database of eight major signaling pathways. We also showed that signaling proteins that participate in multiple pathways included multiple established drug targets and drug target candidates. Lastly, we caution that the pervasive overlap of cellular network modules implies that wider use of multitarget drugs to partially inhibit multiple individual proteins will be necessary to modify specific cellular functions, because targeting single proteins for complete disruption usually affects multiple cellular functions with little specificity for a particular process. Tools for analyzing network topology and especially network dynamics have great potential to identify alternative sets of targets for developing multitarget drugs.},

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster's adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes. The oyster genome sequence fills a void in our understanding of the Lophotrochozoa.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The NCBI dbSNP database lists over 9 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome, but currently contains limited annotation information. SNPs that result in amino acid residue changes (nsSNPs) are of critical importance in variation between individuals, including disease and drug sensitivity.

RESULTS: We have developed LS-SNP, a genomic scale software pipeline to annotate nsSNPs. LS-SNP comprehensively maps nsSNPs onto protein sequences, functional pathways and comparative protein structure models, and predicts positions where nsSNPs destabilize proteins, interfere with the formation of domain-domain interfaces, have an effect on protein-ligand binding or severely impact human health. It currently annotates 28,043 validated SNPs that produce amino acid residue substitutions in human proteins from the SwissProt/TrEMBL database. Annotations can be viewed via a web interface either in the context of a genomic region or by selecting sets of SNPs, genes, proteins or pathways. These results are useful for identifying candidate functional SNPs within a gene, haplotype or pathway and in probing molecular mechanisms responsible for functional impacts of nsSNPs.

@article{Ling2015,
abstract = {SignificanceA tumor comprising many cells can be compared to a natural population with many individuals. The amount of genetic diversity reflects how it has evolved and can influence its future evolution. We evaluated a single tumor by sequencing or genotyping nearly 300 regions from the tumor. When the data were analyzed by modern population genetic theory, we estimated more than 100 million coding region mutations in this unexceptional tumor. The extreme genetic diversity implies evolution under the non-Darwinian mode. In contrast, under the prevailing view of Darwinian selection, the genetic diversity would be orders of magnitude lower. Because genetic diversity accrues rapidly, a high probability of drug resistance should be heeded, even in the treatment of microscopic tumors. The prevailing view that the evolution of cells in a tumor is driven by Darwinian selection has never been rigorously tested. Because selection greatly affects the level of intratumor genetic diversity, it is important to assess whether intratumor evolution follows the Darwinian or the non-Darwinian mode of evolution. To provide the statistical power, many regions in a single tumor need to be sampled and analyzed much more extensively than has been attempted in previous intratumor studies. Here, from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor, we evaluated multiregional samples from the tumor, using either whole-exome sequencing (WES) (n = 23 samples) or genotyping (n = 286) under both the infinite-site and infinite-allele models of population genetics. In addition to the many single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) present in all samples, there were 35 "polymorphic" SNVs among samples. High genetic diversity was evident as the 23 WES samples defined 20 unique cell clones. With all 286 samples genotyped, clonal diversity agreed well with the non-Darwinian model with no evidence of positive Darwinian selection. Under the non-Darwinian model, MALL (the number of coding region mutations in the entire tumor) was estimated to be greater than 100 million in this tumor. DNA sequences reveal local diversities in small patches of cells and validate the estimation. In contrast, the genetic diversity under a Darwinian model would generally be orders of magnitude smaller. Because the level of genetic diversity will have implications on therapeutic resistance, non-Darwinian evolution should be heeded in cancer treatments even for microscopic tumors.},

abstract = {A novel method to measure distances between druggable protein cavities is presented. Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes, to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening.},

abstract = {Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1 nM to 30 $\mu$M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.},

abstract = {Although drugs are intended to be selective, at least some bind to several physiological targets, explaining side effects and efficacy. Because many drug-target combinations exist, it would be useful to explore possible interactions computationally. Here we compared 3,665 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and investigational drugs against hundreds of targets, defining each target by its ligands. Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the beta(1) receptor by the transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H(4) receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug-target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent (<100 nM). The physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many drugs.},

abstract = {Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8. },

@article{Kasahara2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interpretation of binding modes of protein-small ligand complexes from 3D structure data is essential for understanding selective ligand recognition by proteins. It is often performed by visual inspection and sometimes largely depends on a priori knowledge about typical interactions such as hydrogen bonds and $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking. Because it can introduce some biases due to scientists' subjective perspectives, more objective viewpoints considering a wide range of interactions are required.

DESCRIPTION: In this paper, we present a web server for analyzing protein-small ligand interactions on the basis of patterns of atomic contacts, or "interaction patterns" obtained from the statistical analyses of 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes in our previous study. This server can guide visual inspection by providing information about interaction patterns for each atomic contact in 3D structures. Users can visually investigate what atomic contacts in user-specified 3D structures of protein-small ligand complexes are statistically overrepresented. This server consists of two main components: "Complex Analyzer", and "Pattern Viewer". The former provides a 3D structure viewer with annotations of interacting amino acid residues, ligand atoms, and interacting pairs of these. In the annotations of interacting pairs, assignment to an interaction pattern of each contact and statistical preferences of the patterns are presented. The "Pattern Viewer" provides details of each interaction pattern. Users can see visual representations of probability density functions of interactions, and a list of protein-ligand complexes showing similar interactions.

CONCLUSIONS: Users can interactively analyze protein-small ligand binding modes with statistically determined interaction patterns rather than relying on a priori knowledge of the users, by using our new web server named GIANT that is freely available at http://giant.hgc.jp/.},

abstract = {Drug-target interaction (DTI) is the basis of drug discovery and design. It is time consuming and costly to determine DTI experimentally. Hence, it is necessary to develop computational methods for the prediction of potential DTI. Based on complex network theory, three supervised inference methods were developed here to predict DTI and used for drug repositioning, namely drug-based similarity inference (DBSI), target-based similarity inference (TBSI) and network-based inference (NBI). Among them, NBI performed best on four benchmark data sets. Then a drug-target network was created with NBI based on 12,483 FDA-approved and experimental drug-target binary links, and some new DTIs were further predicted. In vitro assays confirmed that five old drugs, namely montelukast, diclofenac, simvastatin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, showed polypharmacological features on estrogen receptors or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV with half maximal inhibitory or effective concentration ranged from 0.2 to 10 µM. Moreover, simvastatin and ketoconazole showed potent antiproliferative activities on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in MTT assays. The results indicated that these methods could be powerful tools in prediction of DTIs and drug repositioning.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is a common goal in biology, and is usually facilitated by having an accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

abstract = {Chimeric RNAs comprise exons from two or more different genes and have the potential to encode novel proteins that alter cellular phenotypes. To date, numerous putative chimeric transcripts have been identified among the ESTs isolated from several organisms and using high throughput RNA sequencing. The few corresponding protein products that have been characterized mostly result from chromosomal translocations and are associated with cancer. Here, we systematically establish that some of the putative chimeric transcripts are genuinely expressed in human cells. Using high throughput RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry experimental data, and functional annotation, we studied 7424 putative human chimeric RNAs. We confirmed the expression of 175 chimeric RNAs in 16 human tissues, with an abundance varying from 0.06 to 17 RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads). We show that these chimeric RNAs are significantly more tissue-specific than non-chimeric transcripts. Moreover, we present evidence that chimeras tend to incorporate highly expressed genes. Despite the low expression level of most chimeric RNAs, we show that 12 novel chimeras are translated into proteins detectable in multiple shotgun mass spectrometry experiments. Furthermore, we confirm the expression of three novel chimeric proteins using targeted mass spectrometry. Finally, based on our functional annotation of exon organization and preserved domains, we discuss the potential features of chimeric proteins with illustrative examples and suggest that chimeras significantly exploit signal peptides and transmembrane domains, which can alter the cellular localization of cognate proteins. Taken together, these findings establish that some chimeric RNAs are translated into potentially functional proteins in humans.},

This paradigm holds great promise for improving cancer treatment; however, allocating specific therapies to the patients who are most likely to derive a durable benefit continues to represent a considerable challenge. Evidence continues to emerge that cancers are characterized by extensive intratumour genetic heterogeneity, and that patients being considered for treatment with a targeted agent might, therefore, already possess resistance to the drug in a minority of cells. Indeed, multiple examples of pre-existing subclonal resistance mutations to various molecularly targeted agents have been described, which we review herein. Early detection of pre-existing or emerging drug resistance could enable more personalized use of targeted cancer therapy, as patients could be stratified to receive the therapies that are most likely to be effective. We consider how monitoring of drug resistance could be incorporated into clinical practice to optimize the use of targeted therapies in individual patients.},

Different routes to produce these biological networks are being combined, including literature curation and computational methods. Experimental approaches to map PPIs mainly rely on the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) technology, which have recently shown to produce reliable protein networks.

abstract = {We present TrixP, a new index-based method for fast protein binding site comparison and function prediction. TrixP determines binding site similarities based on the comparison of descriptors that encode pharmacophoric and spatial features. Therefore, it adopts the efficient core components of TrixX, a structure-based virtual screening technology for large compound libraries. TrixP expands this technology by new components in order to allow a screening of protein libraries. TrixP accounts for the inherent flexibility of proteins employing a partial shape matching routine. After the identification of structures with matching pharmacophoric features and geometric shape, TrixP superimposes the binding sites and, finally, assesses their similarity according to the fit of pharmacophoric properties. TrixP is able to find analogies between closely and distantly related binding sites. Recovery rates of 81.8{\%} for similar binding site pairs, assisted by rejecting rates of 99.5{\%} for dissimilar pairs on a test data set containing 1331 pairs, confirm this ability. TrixP exclusively identifies members of the same protein family on top ranking positions out of a library consisting of 9802 binding sites. Furthermore, 30 predicted kinase binding sites can almost perfectly be classified into their known subfamilies.},

abstract = {A fundamental task in bioinformatics involves a transfer of knowledge from one protein molecule onto another by way of recognizing similarities. Such similarities are obtained at different levels, that of sequence, whole fold, or important substructures. Comparison of binding sites is important to understand functional similarities among the proteins and also to understand drug cross-reactivities. Current methods in literature have their own merits and demerits, warranting exploration of newer concepts and algorithms, especially for large-scale comparisons and for obtaining accurate residue-wise mappings. Here, we report the development of a new algorithm, PocketAlign, for obtaining structural superpositions of binding sites. The software is available as a web-service at http://proline.physics.iisc.ernet.in/pocketalign/. The algorithm encodes shape descriptors in the form of geometric perspectives, supplemented by chemical group classification. The shape descriptor considers several perspectives with each residue as the focus and captures relative distribution of residues around it in a given site. Residue-wise pairings are computed by comparing the set of perspectives of the first site with that of the second, followed by a greedy approach that incrementally combines residue pairings into a mapping. The mappings in different frames are then evaluated by different metrics encoding the extent of alignment of individual geometric perspectives. Different initial seed alignments are computed, each subsequently extended by detecting consequential atomic alignments in a three-dimensional grid, and the best 500 stored in a database. Alignments are then ranked, and the top scoring alignments reported, which are then streamed into Pymol for visualization and analyses. The method is validated for accuracy and sensitivity and benchmarked against existing methods. An advantage of PocketAlign, as compared to some of the existing tools available for binding site comparison in literature, is that it explores different schemes for identifying an alignment thus has a better potential to capture similarities in ligand recognition abilities. PocketAlign, by finding a detailed alignment of a pair of sites, provides insights as to why two sites are similar and which set of residues and atoms contribute to the similarity.},

abstract = {Estimating the pairwise similarity of protein-ligand binding sites is a fast and efficient way of predicting cross-reactivity and putative side effects of drug candidates. Among the many tools available, three-dimensional (3D) alignment-dependent methods are usually slow and based on simplified representations of binding site atoms or surfaces. On the other hand, fast and efficient alignment-free methods have recently been described but suffer from a lack of interpretability. We herewith present a novel binding site description (VolSite), coupled to an alignment and comparison tool (Shaper) combining the speed of alignment-free methods with the interpretability of alignment-dependent approaches. It is based on the comparison of negative images of binding cavities encoding both shape and pharmacophoric properties at regularly spaced grid points. Shaper approximates the resulting molecular shape with a smooth Gaussian function and aligns protein binding sites by optimizing their volume overlap. Volsite and Shaper were successfully applied to compare protein-ligand binding sites and to predict their structural druggability.},

The model was subjected to a 500-ps molecular dynamics simulation, and thereafter new conformers of the receptor model were produced in a simulated annealing procedure. Using an automated docking procedure, well-known cannabimimetic ligands were docked into six different model conformers, of which one was chosen for a detailed study of receptor-ligand interactions. The docking results confirm, for example, the importance of lysine K3.28(192) in the binding of these ligands. Also, other experimental data are fairly consistent with the present model, though there are some differences when compared to other recent CB1 comparison models. The present model will serve as a tool to investigate the receptor-ligand interactions and facilitate the design of novel cannabimimetic drugs.},

The existence of such regions and the continuity of peptide chain within them, coupled with kinetic arguments, suggests that the early stages of three-dimensional structure formation (nucleation) occur independently in separate parts of these molecules. A nucleus can grow rapidly by adding peptide chain segments that are close to the nucleus in aminoacid sequence. Such a process would generate three-dimensional (native) protein structures that contain separate regions of continuous peptide chain. Possible means of testing this hypothesis are discussed.},

We quantitatively estimate the maximal affinity achievable by a drug-like molecule, and we show that these calculated values correlate with drug discovery outcomes. We experimentally test two predictions using high-throughput screening of a diverse compound collection. The collective results highlight the utility of our approach as well as strategies for tackling difficult targets.},

abstract = {Many of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been found to exert variable and even opposing roles in different kinds of tumors or at different stages of cancer development. Here we showed that tumorigenic potential of mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells cultured in adherent plates (attached-P19-cells) was suppressed by a chemotherapeutic agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (ZdCyd), whereas the higher pro-tumorigenicity of P19 cells growing in suspension (detached-P19-cells) was generated by the ZdCyd treatment. Surprisingly, p53 activity was highly up-regulated by ZdCyd in both growing conditions. By our developed computational approaches, we revealed that there was a significant enrichment of apoptotic pathways in the ZdCyd-induced p53-dominant gene-regulatory network in attached P19 cells, whereas the pro-survival genes were significantly enriched in the ZdCyd-induced p53 network in detached P19 cells. The protein-protein interaction network of the ZdCyd-treated detached P19 cells was significantly different from that of ZdCyd-treated attached P19 cells. On the other hand, inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA suppressed the ZdCyd-induced tumorigenesis of detached P19 cells, suggesting that the ZdCyd-activated p53 plays oncogenic function in detached P19 cells. Taken together, these results indicate a context-dependent role for the ZdCyd-activated p53-dominant network in tumorigenesis.},

The great success of the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia illustrates the high potential of kinase inhibitor (KI) therapeutics, but also unveils a major limitation: the development of drug resistance. This is a significant concern as KIs reach large patient populations for an expanding array of indications. AREAS COVERED: we provide an up-to-date understanding of the mechanisms through which KIs function and through which cells can become KI-resistant. We review current and future approaches to overcome KI resistance, focusing on currently approved KIs and KIs in clinical trials. We then discuss approaches to improve KI efficacy and overcome drug resistance and novel approaches to develop less drug resistance-prone KI therapeutics. EXPERT OPINION: although drug resistance is a concern for current KI therapeutics, recent progress in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and promising technological advances may overcome this limitation and provide powerful new therapeutics.},

Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes.

To identify factors that impact drug resistance herein we built a model that couples inherent cell-based response toward drugs with transcriptomes of resistant/sensitive cells. To test this model, we focused on a group of genes called metastasis suppressor genes (MSGs) that influence aggressiveness and metastatic potential of cancers. Interestingly, modeling of 84 000 drug response transcriptome combinations predicted multiple MSGs to be associated with resistance of different cell types and drugs. As a case study, on inducing MSG levels in a drug resistant breast cancer line resistance to anticancer drugs caerulomycin, camptothecin and topotecan decreased by more than 50-60{\%}, in both culture conditions and also in tumors generated in mice, in contrast to control un-induced cells. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of engineered reversal of drug resistance in cancer cells based on a model that exploits inherent cellular response profiles.},

abstract = {The Robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org) provides automated tools for protein structure prediction and analysis. For structure prediction, sequences submitted to the server are parsed into putative domains and structural models are generated using either comparative modeling or de novo structure prediction methods. If a confident match to a protein of known structure is found using BLAST, PSI-BLAST, FFAS03 or 3D-Jury, it is used as a template for comparative modeling. If no match is found, structure predictions are made using the de novo Rosetta fragment insertion method. Experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) constraints data can also be submitted with a query sequence for RosettaNMR de novo structure determination. Other current capabilities include the prediction of the effects of mutations on protein–protein interactions using computational interface alanine scanning. The Rosetta protein design and protein–protein docking methodologies will soon be available through the server as well. },

abstract = {The protein and ligand interaction takes an important part in protein function. Both ligand and its binding site are essential components for understanding how the protein-ligand complex functions. Until now, there have been many studies about protein function and evolution, but they usually lacked ligand information. Accordingly, in this study, we tried to answer the following questions: how much ligand and binding site are associated with protein function, and how ligands themselves are related to each other in terms of binding site. To answer the questions, we presented binding similarity network of ligand. Through the network analysis, we attempted to reveal systematic relationship between the ligand and binding site. The results showed that ligand binding site and function were closely related (conservation ratio, 81{\%}). We also showed conservative tendency of function in line with ligand structure similarity with some exceptional cases. In addition, the binding similarity network of ligand revealed scale-free property to some degree like other biological networks. Since most nodes formed highly connected cluster, a clustering coefficient was very high compared with random. All the highly connected ligands (hubs) were involved in various functions forming large cluster and tended to act as a bridge between modular clusters in the network.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal dissection of the genomic changes occurring during the evolution of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may help elucidate the basis for its dismal prognosis. We sequenced 25 spatially distinct regions from seven operable NSCLCs and found evidence of branched evolution, with driver mutations arising before and after subclonal diversification. There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection. The regionally separated driver mutations, coupled with the relentless and heterogeneous nature of the genome instability processes, are likely to confound treatment success in NSCLC},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In the field of drug discovery, assessing the potential of multidrug therapies is a difficult task because of the combinatorial complexity (both theoretical and experimental) and because of the requirements on the selectivity of the therapy. To cope with this problem, we have developed a novel method for the systematic in silico investigation of synergistic effects of currently available drugs on genome-scale metabolic networks. The algorithm finds the optimal combination of drugs which guarantees the inhibition of an objective function, while minimizing the side effect on the overall network. RESULTS: Two different applications are considered: finding drug synergisms for human metabolic diseases (like diabetes, obesity and hypertension) and finding antitumoral drug combinations with minimal side effect on the normal human metabolism. The results we obtain are consistent with some of the available therapeutic indications and predict some new multiple drug treatments. A cluster analysis on all possible interactions among the currently available drugs indicates a limited variety on the metabolic targets for the approved drugs. CONCLUSION: The in silico prediction of drug synergism can represent an important tool for the repurposing of drug in a realistic perspective which considers also the selectivty of the therapy. Moreover, for a more profitable exploitation of drug-drug interactions, also drugs which show a too low efficacy but which have a non-common mechanism of action, can be reconsider as potential ingredients of new multicompound therapeutic indications. Needless to say the clues provided by a computational study like ours need in any case to be thoroughly evaluated experimentally.},

abstract = {Obesity and patient morbidity has become a health concern worldwide. Obesity is associated with over activity of the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in the regulation of appetite, lipogenesis and insulin resistance. Hypothalamic cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) inverse agonists reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic abnormalities in experimental and human obesity but displayed neuropsychiatric side effects. Hence, there is a need to develop therapeutics which employs blocking peripheral CB1 receptors and still achieve substantial weight loss. In view of the same, adipose tissue CB1 receptors are employed for this study since it is more specific in reducing visceral fat. Computer aided structure based virtual screening finds application to screen novel inhibitors and develop highly selective and potential drug. The rational drug design requires crystal structure for the CB1 receptor. However, the structure for the CB1 receptor is not available in its native form. Thus, we modelled the crystal structure using a lipid G-Protein coupled receptor (PDB: 3V2W, chain A) as template. Furthermore, we have screened a herbal ligand Quercetin [- 2- (3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) - 3, 5, 7-trihydroxychromen-4-one] a flavonol present in Mimosa pudica based on its better pharmacokinetics and bioavailability profile. This ligand was selected as an ideal lead molecule. The docking of quercetin with CB1 receptor showed a binding energy of -6.56 Kcal/mol with 4 hydrogen bonds, in comparison to the known drug Rimonabant. This data finds application in proposing antagonism of CB1 receptor with Quercetin, for controlling obesity.},

However, almost all the screening efforts for novel ligand discovery rely exclusively on cellular systems overexpressing the receptors. An alternative ligand discovery strategy is a fragment-based drug discovery, where low molecular weight compounds, known as fragments, are screened as initial starting points for optimization. However, the screening of fragment libraries usually employs biophysical screening methods, and as such, it has not been routinely applied to membrane proteins. We present here a surface plasmon resonance biosensor approach that enables, cell-free, label-free, fragment screening that directly measures fragment interactions with wild-type GPCRs.

abstract = {The type 1 sigma receptor (sigmaR1) has been shown to participate in a variety of functions in the central nervous system. To identify the specific regions of the brain that are involved in sigmaR1 function, we analyzed the expression pattern of the receptor mRNA in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. SigmaR1 mRNA was detectable primarily in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. To identify the critical anionic amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain of sigmaR1, we employed two different approaches: chemical modification of anionic amino acid residues and site-directed mutagenesis. Chemical modification of anionic amino acids in sigmaR1 with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide reduced the ligand-binding activity markedly. Since it is known that a splice variant of this receptor which lacks exon 3 does not have the ability to bind sigma ligands, the ligand-binding domain with its critical anionic amino acid residues is likely to be present in or around the region coded by exon 3. Therefore, each of the anionic amino acids in this region was mutated individually and the influence of each mutation on ligand binding was assessed. These studies have identified two anionic amino acids, D126 and E172, that are obligatory for ligand binding. Even though the ligand-binding function was abolished by these two mutations, the expression of these mutants was normal at the protein level. These results show that sigmaR1 is expressed at high levels in specific areas of the brain that are involved in memory, emotion and motor functions. The results also provide important information on the chemical nature of the ligand-binding site of sigmaR1 that may be of use in the design of sigmaR1-specific ligands with potential for modulation of sigmaR1-related brain functions.},

abstract = {Communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion is important for bioenergetics and cellular survival. The ER supplies Ca(2+) directly to mitochondria via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) at close contacts between the two organelles referred to as mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM). We found here that the ER protein sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), which is implicated in neuroprotection, carcinogenesis, and neuroplasticity, is a Ca(2+)-sensitive and ligand-operated receptor chaperone at MAM. Normally, Sig-1Rs form a complex at MAM with another chaperone, BiP. Upon ER Ca(2+) depletion or via ligand stimulation, Sig-1Rs dissociate from BiP, leading to a prolonged Ca(2+) signaling into mitochondria via IP3Rs. Sig-1Rs can translocate under chronic ER stress. Increasing Sig-1Rs in cells counteracts ER stress response, whereas decreasing them enhances apoptosis. These results reveal that the orchestrated ER chaperone machinery at MAM, by sensing ER Ca(2+) concentrations, regulates ER-mitochondrial interorganellar Ca(2+) signaling and cell survival.},

abstract = {Machine learning methods based on ligand-protein interaction data in bioactivity databases are one of the current strategies for efficiently finding novel lead compounds as the first step in the drug discovery process. Although previous machine learning studies have succeeded in predicting novel ligand-protein interactions with high performance, all of the previous studies to date have been heavily dependent on the simple use of raw bioactivity data of ligand potencies measured by IC50, EC50, Ki, and Kd deposited in databases. ChEMBL provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate whether a machine-learning-based classifier created by reflecting ligand efficiency other than the IC50, EC50, Ki, and Kd values can also offer high predictive performance. Here we report that classifiers created from training data based on ligand efficiency show higher performance than those from data based on IC50 or Ki values. Utilizing GPCRSARfari and KinaseSARfari databases in ChEMBL, we created IC50- or Ki-based training data and binding efficiency index (BEI)-based training data, then constructed classifiers using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM classifiers from the BEI-based training data showed slightly higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the cross validation tests. Application of the classifiers to the validation data demonstrated that the AUCs and specificities of the BEI-based classifiers dramatically increased in comparison with the IC50- or Ki-based classifiers. The improvement of the predictive power by the BEI-based classifiers can be attributed to i) the more separated distributions of positives and negatives, ii) the higher diversity of negatives in the BEI-based training data in a feature space of SVMs, and iii) a more balanced number of positives and negatives in the BEI-based training data. These results strongly suggest that training data based on ligand efficiency as well as data based on classical IC50, EC50, Kd, Ki values are important when creating a classifier using a machine learning approach based on bioactivity data.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which compounds discovered using cell-based phenotypic screening strategies might exert their effects would be highly augmented by new approaches exploring their potential interactions with the genome. For example, altered androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional programs, including castration resistance and subsequent chromosomal translocations, play key roles in prostate cancer pathological progression, making the quest for identification of new therapeutic agents and an understanding of their actions a continued priority. Here we report an approach that has permitted us to uncover the sites and mechanisms of action of a drug, referred to as "SD70," initially identified by phenotypic screening for inhibitors of ligand and genotoxic stress-induced translocations in prostate cancer cells. Based on synthesis of a derivatized form of SD70 that permits its application for a ChIP-sequencing-like approach, referred to as "Chem-seq," we were next able to efficiently map the genome-wide binding locations of this small molecule, revealing that it largely colocalized with AR on regulatory enhancers. Based on these observations, we performed the appropriate global analyses to ascertain that SD70 inhibits the androgen-dependent AR program, and prostate cancer cell growth, acting, at least in part, by functionally inhibiting the Jumonji domain-containing demethylase, KDM4C. Global location of candidate drugs represents a powerful strategy for new drug development by mapping genome-wide location of small molecules, a powerful adjunct to contemporary drug development strategies.},

abstract = {Spliceostatin A (SSA) is a stabilized derivative of a Pseudomonas bacterial fermentation product that displays potent anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activities in cancer cells and animal models. The drug inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo and binds SF3b, a protein subcomplex of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is essential for recognition of the pre-mRNA branch point. We report that SSA prevents interaction of an SF3b 155-kDa subunit with the pre-mRNA, concomitant with nonproductive recruitment of U2 snRNP to sequences 5' of the branch point. Differences in base-pairing potential with U2 snRNA in this region lead to different sensitivity of 3' splice sites to SSA, and to SSA-induced changes in alternative splicing. Indeed, rather than general splicing inhibition, splicing-sensitive microarray analyses reveal specific alternative splicing changes induced by the drug that significantly overlap with those induced by knockdown of SF3b 155. These changes lead to down-regulation of genes important for cell division, including cyclin A2 and Aurora A kinase, thus providing an explanation for the anti-proliferative effects of SSA. Our results reveal a mechanism that prevents nonproductive base-pairing interactions in the spliceosome, and highlight the regulatory and cancer therapeutic potential of perturbing the fidelity of splice site recognition.},

With these PDXs, we performed in vivo compound screens using a 1 [times] 1 [times] 1 experimental design (PDX clinical trial or PCT) to assess the population responses to 62 treatments across six indications. We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We therefore propose that this experimental paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of treatment modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial responses.},

abstract = {Advances reported over the last few years and the increasing availability of protein crystal structure data have greatly improved structure-based druggability approaches. However, in practice, nearly all druggability estimation methods are applied to protein crystal structures as rigid proteins, with protein flexibility often not directly addressed. The inclusion of protein flexibility is important in correctly identifying the druggability of pockets that would be missed by methods based solely on the rigid crystal structure. These include cryptic pockets and flexible pockets often found at protein-protein interaction interfaces. Here, we apply an approach that uses protein modeling in concert with druggability estimation to account for light protein backbone movement and protein side-chain flexibility in protein binding sites. We assess the advantages and limitations of this approach on widely-used protein druggability sets. Applying the approach to all mammalian protein crystal structures in the PDB results in identification of 69 proteins with potential druggable cryptic pockets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phenotypic effects of drugs are involved in the interactions between drugs and their target proteins, however, our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of the drug-target interactions is very limited. One of challenging issues in recent pharmaceutical science is to identify the underlying molecular features which govern drug-target interactions.

RESULTS: In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of the correlation between drug side effects and protein domains, which we call "pharmacogenomic features," based on the drug-target interaction network. We detect drug side effects and protein domains that appear jointly in known drug-target interactions, which is made possible by using classifiers with sparse models. It is shown that the inferred pharmacogenomic features can be used for predicting potential drug-target interactions. We also discuss advantages and limitations of the pharmacogenomic features, compared with the chemogenomic features that are the associations between drug chemical substructures and protein domains.

CONCLUSION: The inferred side effect-domain association network is expected to be useful for estimating common drug side effects for different protein families and characteristic drug side effects for specific protein domains.},

abstract = {"Statistical potentials" are energies widely used in computer algorithms to fold, dock, or recognize protein structures. They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of those assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10{\%} incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

abstract = {To better understand the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of human disease, we systematically examine relationships between 3,949 genes, 62,663 mutations and 3,453 associated disorders by generating a three-dimensional, structurally resolved human interactome. This network consists of 4,222 high-quality binary protein-protein interactions with their atomic-resolution interfaces. We find that in-frame mutations (missense point mutations and in-frame insertions and deletions) are enriched on the interaction interfaces of proteins associated with the corresponding disorders, and that the disease specificity for different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their location within an interface. We also predict 292 candidate genes for 694 unknown disease-to-gene associations with proposed molecular mechanism hypotheses. This work indicates that knowledge of how in-frame disease mutations alter specific interactions is critical to understanding pathogenesis. Structurally resolved interaction networks should be valuable tools for interpreting the wealth of data being generated by large-scale structural genomics and disease association studies.},

The growth of a tumor is therefore a form of evolution at the somatic level, in which the population is comprised of individual cells within the tumor. Models of tumorigenesis have considered the relative importance of mutation and selection. We show that selection is more important than an increased mutation rate in the growth of a tumor. Some cancers may acquire a "mutator phenotype," probably leading to faster growth, but mutator phenotypes are not necessary for carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Mycolic acids are vital components of the cell wall of the tubercle bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are required for viability and virulence. While mycolic acid biosynthesis is studied extensively, components involved in mycolate transport remain unidentified. We investigated the role of large membrane proteins encoded by mmpL genes in mycolic acid transport in mycobacteria and the related corynebacteria. MmpL3 was found to be essential in mycobacteria and conditional depletion of MmpL3 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in loss of cell wall mycolylation, and of the cell wall-associated glycolipid, trehalose dimycolate. In parallel, an accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) was observed, suggesting that mycolic acids were transported as TMM. In contrast to mycobacteria, we found redundancy in the role of two mmpL genes, in Corynebacterium glutamicum; a complete loss of trehalose-associated and cell wall bound corynomycolates was observed in an NCgl0228-NCgl2769 double mutant, but not in individual single mutants. Our studies highlight the role of mmpL genes in mycolic acid metabolism and identify potential new targets for anti-TB drug development.},

abstract = {Binding hot spots, protein sites with high-binding affinity, can be identified using X-ray crystallography or NMR by screening libraries of small organic molecules that tend to cluster at such regions. FTMAP, a direct computational analog of the experimental screening approaches, globally samples the surface of a target protein using small organic molecules as probes, finds favorable positions, clusters the conformations and ranks the clusters on the basis of the average energy. The regions that bind several probe clusters predict the binding hot spots, in good agreement with experimental results. Small molecules discovered by fragment-based approaches to drug design also bind at the hot spot regions. To identify such molecules and their most likely bound positions, we extend the functionality of FTMAP (http://ftmap.bu.edu/param) to accept any small molecule as an additional probe. In its updated form, FTMAP identifies the hot spots based on a standard set of probes, and for each additional probe shows representative structures of nearby low energy clusters. This approach helps to predict bound poses of the user-selected molecules, detects if a compound is not likely to bind in the hot spot region, and provides input for the design of larger ligands.},

abstract = {Increased proliferation and elevated levels of protein synthesis are characteristics of transformed and tumor cells. Though components of the translation machinery are often misregulated in cancers, what role tRNA plays in cancer cells has not been explored. We compare genome-wide tRNA expression in cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived breast cell lines, as well as tRNA expression in breast tumors versus normal breast tissues. In cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived cell lines, nuclear-encoded tRNAs increase by up to 3-fold and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs increase by up to 5-fold. In tumors versus normal breast tissues, both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs increase up to 10-fold. This tRNA over-expression is selective and coordinates with the properties of cognate amino acids. Nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs exhibit distinct expression patterns, indicating that tRNAs can be used as biomarkers for breast cancer. We also performed association analysis for codon usage-tRNA expression for the cell lines. tRNA isoacceptor expression levels are not geared towards optimal translation of house-keeping or cell line specific genes. Instead, tRNA isoacceptor expression levels may favor the translation of cancer-related genes having regulatory roles. Our results suggest a functional consequence of tRNA over-expression in tumor cells. tRNA isoacceptor over-expression may increase the translational efficiency of genes relevant to cancer development and progression.},

SPR biosensor interaction analysis is employed to both screen and confirm the binding of compounds in fragment screening experiments, as it provides accurate information on the affinity and kinetics of molecular interactions. The most advanced application of the use of SPR for fragment screening is against membrane protein drug targets, such G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). SPR biophysical GPCR assays using have been validated with pharmacological measurements approximate to cell-based methods, yet provide the advantage of biophysical methods in their ability to measure the weak affinities of low molecular weight fragments. A number of SPR fragment screens against GPCRs have now been disclosed in the literature. SPR fragment screening is proving versatile to screen both thermostabilised GPCRs and solubilised wild type receptors. In this chapter, we discuss the state-of-the-art in GPCR fragment screening by SPR and the technical considerations in performing such experiments.},

@article{Haupt2013,
abstract = {Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new disease indications with increasing success. A pre-requisite for drug repurposing is drug promiscuity (polypharmacology) - a drug's ability to bind to several targets. There is a long standing debate on the reasons for drug promiscuity. Based on large compound screens, hydrophobicity and molecular weight have been suggested as key reasons. However, the results are sometimes contradictory and leave space for further analysis. Protein structures offer a structural dimension to explain promiscuity: Can a drug bind multiple targets because the drug is flexible or because the targets are structurally similar or even share similar binding sites? We present a systematic study of drug promiscuity based on structural data of PDB target proteins with a set of 164 promiscuous drugs. We show that there is no correlation between the degree of promiscuity and ligand properties such as hydrophobicity or molecular weight but a weak correlation to conformational flexibility. However, we do find a correlation between promiscuity and structural similarity as well as binding site similarity of protein targets. In particular, 71{\%} of the drugs have at least two targets with similar binding sites. In order to overcome issues in detection of remotely similar binding sites, we employed a score for binding site similarity: LigandRMSD measures the similarity of the aligned ligands and uncovers remote local similarities in proteins. It can be applied to arbitrary structural binding site alignments. Three representative examples, namely the anti-cancer drug methotrexate, the natural product quercetin and the anti-diabetic drug acarbose are discussed in detail. Our findings suggest that global structural and binding site similarity play a more important role to explain the observed drug promiscuity in the PDB than physicochemical drug properties like hydrophobicity or molecular weight. Additionally, we find ligand flexibility to have a minor influence.},

Consequently, these studies are limited in their discovery of new and unknown disease relationships. We present the first quantitative framework to compare and contrast diseases by an integrated analysis of disease-related mRNA expression data and the human protein interaction network. We identified 4,620 functional modules in the human protein network and provided a quantitative metric to record their responses in 54 diseases leading to 138 significant similarities between diseases. Fourteen of the significant disease correlations also shared common drugs, supporting the hypothesis that similar diseases can be treated by the same drugs, allowing us to make predictions for new uses of existing drugs. Finally, we also identified 59 modules that were dysregulated in at least half of the diseases, representing a common disease-state "signature". These modules were significantly enriched for genes that are known to be drug targets. Interestingly, drugs known to target these genes/proteins are already known to treat significantly more diseases than drugs targeting other genes/proteins, highlighting the importance of these core modules as prime therapeutic opportunities.},

Evidence is mounting that polypharmacological drug behavior is often responsible for therapeutic efficacy suggesting the consideration of new drug development strategies. Target promiscuity of compounds is at the origin of polypharmacology. For many bioactive compounds, multiple target annotations are available indicating that compound promiscuity is a general phenomenon. However, careful analysis of compound activity data reveals that the degree of apparent promiscuity is strongly influenced by data selection criteria and the type of activity measurements that are considered. Furthermore, promiscuity involving unrelated targets is less common. Apparent target promiscuity might often better be interpreted as activity promiscuity in different assays.},

abstract = {Major goal of structural biology involve formation of protein-ligand complexes; in which the protein molecules act energetically in the course of binding. Therefore, perceptive of protein-ligand interaction will be very important for structure based drug design. Lack of knowledge of 3D structures has hindered efforts to understand the binding specificities of ligands with protein. With increasing in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, homology modeling is rapidly becoming the method of choice for obtaining 3D coordinates of proteins. Homology modeling is a representation of the similarity of environmental residues at topologically corresponding positions in the reference proteins. In the absence of experimental data, model building on the basis of a known 3D structure of a homologous protein is at present the only reliable method to obtain the structural information. Knowledge of the 3D structures of proteins provides invaluable insights into the molecular basis of their functions. The recent advances in homology modeling, particularly in detecting and aligning sequences with template structures, distant homologues, modeling of loops and side chains as well as detecting errors in a model contributed to consistent prediction of protein structure, which was not possible even several years ago. This review focused on the features and a role of homology modeling in predicting protein structure and described current developments in this field with victorious applications at the different stages of the drug design and discovery.},

abstract = {Identification of chemical compounds with specific biological activities is an important step in both chemical biology and drug discovery. When the structure of the intended target is available, one approach is to use molecular docking programs to assess the chemical complementarity of small molecules with the target; such calculations provide a qualitative measure of affinity that can be used in virtual screening (VS) to rank order a list of compounds according to their potential to be active. rDock is a molecular docking program developed at Vernalis for high-throughput VS (HTVS) applications. Evolved from RiboDock, the program can be used against proteins and nucleic acids, is designed to be computationally very efficient and allows the user to incorporate additional constraints and information as a bias to guide docking. This article provides an overview of the program structure and features and compares rDock to two reference programs, AutoDock Vina (open source) and Schr{\"{o}}dinger's Glide (commercial). In terms of computational speed for VS, rDock is faster than Vina and comparable to Glide. For binding mode prediction, rDock and Vina are superior to Glide. The VS performance of rDock is significantly better than Vina, but inferior to Glide for most systems unless pharmacophore constraints are used; in that case rDock and Glide are of equal performance. The program is released under the Lesser General Public License and is freely available for download, together with the manuals, example files and the complete test sets, at http://rdock.sourceforge.net/},

Here we focus on predicting drug response based on a cohort of genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiling data sets measured in human breast cancer cell lines. Through a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we analyzed a total of 44 drug sensitivity prediction algorithms. The top-performing approaches modeled nonlinear relationships and incorporated biological pathway information. We found that gene expression microarrays consistently provided the best predictive power of the individual profiling data sets; however, performance was increased by including multiple, independent data sets. We discuss the innovations underlying the top-performing methodology, Bayesian multitask MKL, and we provide detailed descriptions of all methods. This study establishes benchmarks for drug sensitivity prediction and identifies approaches that can be leveraged for the development of new methods.},

@article{Ahmed2012,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: S2R (sigma-2 receptor)/Pgrmc1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is a cytochrome-related protein that binds directly to heme and various pharmacological compounds. S2R(Pgrmc1) also associates with cytochrome P450 proteins, the EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase and the RNA-binding protein PAIR-BP1. S2R(Pgrmc1) is induced in multiple types of cancer, where it regulates tumor growth and is implicated in progesterone signaling. S2R(Pgrmc1) also increases cholesterol synthesis in non-cancerous cells and may have a role in modulating drug metabolizing P450 proteins. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the independent identification of S2R and Pgrmc1 and their induction in cancers, as well as the role of S2R(Pgrmc1) in increasing cholesterol metabolism and P450 activity. This article was formed through a PubMed literature search using, but not limited to, the terms sigma-2 receptor, Pgrmc1, Dap1, cholesterol and aromatase. EXPERT OPINION: Multiple laboratories have shown that S2R(Pgrmc1) associates with various P450 proteins and increases cholesterol synthesis via Cyp51. However, the lipogenic role of S2R(Pgrmc1) is tissue-specific. Furthermore, the role of S2R(Pgrmc1) in regulating P450 proteins other than Cyp51 appears to be highly selective, with modest inhibitory activity for Cyp3A4 in vitro and a complex regulatory pattern for Cyp21. Cyp19/aromatase is a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and S2R(Pgrmc1) activated Cyp19 significantly in vitro but modestly in biochemical assays. In summary, S2R(Pgrmc1) is a promising therapeutic target for cancer and possibly cholesterol synthesis but research to date has not identified a major role in P450-mediated drug metabolism.},

abstract = {Here we perform whole-exome sequencing of samples from 105 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent leukemia in adults in Western countries. We found 1,246 somatic mutations potentially affecting gene function and identified 78 genes with predicted functional alterations in more than one tumor sample. Among these genes, SF3B1, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), is somatically mutated in 9.7{\%} of affected individuals. Further analysis in 279 individuals with CLL showed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with faster disease progression and poor overall survival. This work provides the first comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in CLL with relevant clinical correlates and defines a large set of new genes that may drive the development of this common form of leukemia. The results reinforce the idea that targeting several well-known genetic pathways, including mRNA splicing, could be useful in the treatment of CLL and other malignancies.},

abstract = {Methods have been developed to assess the stereochemical quality of any protein structure both globally and locally using various criteria. Several parameters can be derived from the coordinates of a given structure. Global parameters include the distribution of phi, psi and chi 1 torsion angles, and hydrogen bond energies. There are clear correlations between these parameters and resolution; as the resolution improves, the distribution of the parameters becomes more clustered. These features show a broad distribution about ideal values derived from high-resolution structures. Some structures have tightly clustered distributions even at relatively low resolutions, while others show abnormal scatter though the data go to high resolution. Additional indicators of local irregularity include proline phi angles, peptide bond planarities, disulfide bond lengths, and their chi 3 torsion angles. These stereochemical parameters have been used to generate measures of stereochemical quality which provide a simple guide as to the reliability of a structure, in addition to the most important measures, resolution and R-factor. The parameters used in this evaluation are not novel, and are easily calculated from structure coordinates. A program suite is currently being developed which will quickly check a given structure, highlighting unusual stereochemistry and possible errors.},

Here we report an atomic structure of human [ggr]-secretase at 3.4 A resolution, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer/'s disease affect residues at two hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four transmembrane segment (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit considerable flexibility, yielding a plastic active site and adaptable surrounding elements. The active site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side of the TM horseshoe, suggesting considerable conformational changes in nicastrin extracellular domain after substrate recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves as a scaffold, anchoring the lone transmembrane helix from nicastrin and supporting the flexible conformation of PS1. Ordered phospholipids stabilize the complex inside the membrane. Our structure serves as a molecular basis for mechanistic understanding of [ggr]-secretase function.},

In the absence of experimental 3D structures, protein structure prediction often offers a suitable alternative to facilitate structure-based studies. This review outlines recent methodical advances in homology modelling, with a focus on those techniques that necessitate consideration of ligand binding. In this context, model quality estimation deserves special attention because the accuracy and reliability of different structure prediction techniques vary considerably, and the quality of a model ultimately determines its usefulness for structure-based drug discovery. Examples of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ADMET-related proteins were selected to illustrate recent progress and current limitations of protein structure prediction. Basic guidelines for good modelling practice are also provided.},

Recent studies in our laboratory using radiolabeled photoreactive ligands suggested that the steroid binding domain-like I (SBDLI) (amino acids 91-109) and the steroid binding domain-like II (SBDLII) (amino acids 176-194) regions are involved in forming the ligand binding site(s) ( Chen, Y., Hajipour, A. R., Sievert, M. K., Arbabian, M., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 3532-3542 ; Pal, A., Hajipour, A. R., Fontanilla, D., Ramachandran, S., Chu, U. B., Mavlyutov, T., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Mol. Pharmacol. 72, 921-933 ). In this report, we have further addressed this issue by utilizing our previously developed sulfhydryl-reactive, cleavable, radioiodinated photocross-linking reagent: methanesulfonothioic acid, S-((4-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzoyl) phenyl)methyl) ester (Guo, L. W., Hajipour, A. R., Gavala, M. L., Arbabian, M., Martemyanov, K. A., Arshavsky, V. Y., and Ruoho, A. E. (2005) Bioconjugate Chem. 16, 685-693). This photoprobe was shown to derivatize the single cysteine residues as mixed disulfides at position 94 in the SBDLI region of the wild type guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (Cys94) and at position 190 in the SBDLII region of a mutant guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (C94A,V190C), both in a sigma-ligand (haloperidol or (+)-pentazocine)-sensitive manner. Significantly, photocross-linking followed by Endo Lys-C cleavage under reducing conditions and intramolecular radiolabel transfer from the SBDLI to the SBDLII region in the wild type receptor and, conversely, from the SBDLII to the SBDLI region in the mutant receptor were observed. These data support a model in which the SBDLI and SBDLII regions are juxtaposed to form, at least in part, a ligand binding site of the sigma-1 receptor.},

abstract = {The identification of rules governing molecular recognition between drug chemical substructures and protein functional sites is a challenging issue at many stages of the drug development process. In this paper we develop a novel method to extract sets of drug chemical substructures and protein domains that govern drug-target interactions on a genome-wide scale. This is made possible using sparse canonical correspondence analysis (SCCA) for analyzing drug substructure profiles and protein domain profiles simultaneously. The method does not depend on the availability of protein 3D structures. From a data set of known drug-target interactions including enzymes, ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and nuclear receptors, we extract a set of chemical substructures shared by drugs able to bind to a set of protein domains. These two sets of extracted chemical substructures and protein domains form components that can be further exploited in a drug discovery process. This approach successfully clusters protein domains that may be evolutionary unrelated but that bind a common set of chemical substructures. As shown in several examples, it can also be very helpful for predicting new protein-ligand interactions and addressing the problem of ligand specificity. The proposed method constitutes a contribution to the recent field of chemogenomics that aims to connect the chemical space with the biological space.},

abstract = {Drug resistance is a major challenge for the treatment of many diseases and a significant concern throughout the drug development process. The ability to understand and predict the effects of mutations on protein-ligand affinities and their roles in the emergence of resistance would significantly aid treatment and drug design strategies. In order to study and understand the impacts of missense mutations on the interaction of ligands with the proteome, we have developed Platinum (http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/platinum). This manually curated, literature-derived database, comprising over 1000 mutations, associates for the first time experimental information on changes in affinity with three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes. To minimize differences arising from experimental techniques and to directly compare binding affinities, Platinum considers only changes measured by the same group and with the same amino-acid sequence used for structure determination, providing a direct link between protein structure, how a ligand binds and how mutations alter the affinity of the ligand of the protein. We believe Platinum will be an invaluable resource for understanding the effects of mutations that give rise to drug resistance, a major problem emerging in pandemics including those caused by the influenza virus, in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, in cancer and in many other life-threatening illnesses.},

abstract = {Systematic identification of protein-drug interaction networks is crucial to correlate complex modes of drug action to clinical indications. We introduce a novel computational strategy to identify protein-ligand binding profiles on a genome-wide scale and apply it to elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with the adverse drug effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) inhibitors. CETP inhibitors are a new class of preventive therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies indicated that one CETP inhibitor, Torcetrapib, has deadly off-target effects as a result of hypertension, and hence it has been withdrawn from phase III clinical trials. We have identified a panel of off-targets for Torcetrapib and other CETP inhibitors from the human structural genome and map those targets to biological pathways via the literature. The predicted protein-ligand network is consistent with experimental results from multiple sources and reveals that the side-effect of CETP inhibitors is modulated through the combinatorial control of multiple interconnected pathways. Given that combinatorial control is a common phenomenon observed in many biological processes, our findings suggest that adverse drug effects might be minimized by fine-tuning multiple off-target interactions using single or multiple therapies. This work extends the scope of chemogenomics approaches and exemplifies the role that systems biology has in the future of drug discovery.},

@article{Nicolaou2009,
abstract = {Drug discovery and development is a complex, lengthy process, and failure of a candidate molecule can occur as a result of a combination of reasons, such as poor pharmacokinetics, lack of efficacy, or toxicity. Successful drug candidates necessarily represent a compromise between the numerous, sometimes competing objectives so that the benefits to patients outweigh potential drawbacks and risks. De novo drug design involves searching an immense space of feasible, druglike molecules to select those with the highest chances of becoming drugs using computational technology. Traditionally, de novo design has focused on designing molecules satisfying a single objective, such as similarity to a known ligand or an interaction score, and ignored the presence of the multiple objectives required for druglike behavior. Recently, methods have appeared in the literature that attempt to design molecules satisfying multiple predefined objectives and thereby produce candidate solutions with a higher chance of serving as viable drug leads. This paper describes the Multiobjective Evolutionary Graph Algorithm (MEGA), a new multiobjective optimization de novo design algorithmic framework that can be used to design structurally diverse molecules satisfying one or more objectives. The algorithm combines evolutionary techniques with graph-theory to directly manipulate graphs and perform an efficient global search for promising solutions. In the Experimental Section we present results from the application of MEGA for designing molecules that selectively bind to a known pharmaceutical target using the ChillScore interaction score family. The primary constraints applied to the design are based on the identified structure of the protein target and a known ligand currently marketed as a drug. A detailed explanation of the key elements of the specific implementation of the algorithm is given, including the methods for obtaining molecular building blocks, evolving the chemical graphs, and scoring the designed molecules. Our findings demonstrate that MEGA can produce structurally diverse candidate molecules representing a wide range of compromises of the supplied constraints and thus can be used as an "idea generator" to support expert chemists assigned with the task of molecular design.},

Although several computational tools for predicting such targets are publicly available, none of these methods was explicitly designed to predict target engagement by de novo-designed molecules. Here we present the development and practical application of a unique technique, self-organizing map-based prediction of drug equivalence relationships (SPiDER), that merges the concepts of self-organizing maps, consensus scoring, and statistical analysis to successfully identify targets for both known drugs and computer-generated molecular scaffolds. We discovered a potential off-target liability of fenofibrate-related compounds, and in a comprehensive prospective application, we identified a multitarget-modulating profile of de novo designed molecules. These results demonstrate that SPiDER may be used to identify innovative compounds in chemical biology and in the early stages of drug discovery, and help investigate the potential side effects of drugs and their repurposing options.},

We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method.},

abstract = {Chemotherapeutic and cytotoxic drugs are widely used in the treatment of cancer. In spite of the improvements in the life quality of patients, their effectiveness is compromised by several disadvantages. This represents a demand for developing new effective strategies with focusing on tumor cells and minimum side effects. Targeted cancer therapies and personalized medicine have been defined as a new type of emerging treatments. Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) are among the most effective drugs for targeted cancer therapy. The growing number of approved SMIs of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the clinical oncology imply the increasing attention and application of these therapeutic tools. Most of the current approved RTK–TKIs in preclinical and clinical settings are multi-targeted inhibitors with several side effects. Only a few specific/selective RTK–TKIs have been developed for 
the treatment of cancer patients. Specific/selective RTK–TKIs have shown less deleterious effects compared to multi-targeted inhibitors. This review intends to highlight the importance of specific/selective TKIs for future development with less side effects and more manageable agents. This article provides an overview of: (1) the characteristics and function of RTKs 
and TKIs; (2) the recent advances in the improvement of specific/selective RTK–TKIs in preclinical or clinical settings; and (3) emerging RTKs for targeted cancer therapies by TKIs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutations play fundamental roles in evolution by introducing diversity into genomes. Missense mutations in structural genes may become either selectively advantageous or disadvantageous to the organism by affecting protein stability and/or interfering with interactions between partners. Thus, the ability to predict the impact of mutations on protein stability and interactions is of significant value, particularly in understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic mutations on the progression of disease. Here, we propose a novel approach to the study of missense mutations, called mCSM, which relies on graph-based signatures. These encode distance patterns between atoms and are used to represent the protein residue environment and to train predictive models. To understand the roles of mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on protein stability but also on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that mCSM performs as well as or better than other methods that are used widely. The mCSM signatures were successfully used in different tasks demonstrating that the impact of a mutation can be correlated with the atomic-distance patterns surrounding an amino acid residue. We showed that mCSM can predict stability changes of a wide range of mutations occurring in the tumour suppressor protein p53, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method in a challenging disease scenario.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A web server is available at http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/mcsm.},

abstract = {Despite the sequencing of the human genome, the rate of innovative and successful drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry has continued to decrease. Leaving aside regulatory matters, I propose that the following fundamental and interlinked intellectual issues are largely responsible: The move from 'function-first' to 'target-first' methods of screening and drug discovery The belief that successful drugs should and do interact solely with single, individual targets, despite natural evolution's selection for biochemical networks that are robust to individual parameter changes Over-reliance on the 'rule of 5' (Ro5) to constrain biophysical and chemical properties of drug libraries The general abandoning of natural products that do not obey the Ro5 An incorrect belief that drugs diffuse passively into (and presumably out of) cells across the bilayers portions of membranes, according to their lipophilicity A widespread failure to recognize the overwhelmingly important role of proteinaceous transporters, and their expression profiles, in determining drug distribution in and between different tissues and individual patients The general failure to use engineering principles to model biology in parallel with performing 'wet' experiments, so that 'what if?' experiments can be performed in silico to assess the likely success of any strategy I illustrate these facts/ideas with a reasonably extensive literature review. Success in turning round drug discovery consequently requires Decent systems biology models of human biochemical networks The use of them, iteratively with experiments, to model how drugs need to interact with multiple targets to have substantive effects on the phenotype Adoption of polypharmacology and/or cocktails of drugs as a desirable goal in itself Incorporation of drug transporters into systems biology models, en route to full and multi-scale systems biology models that incorporate drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion A return to 'function-first' or phenotypic screening Novel methods for inferring modes of action by measuring the properties on system variables at all levels of the 'omes. Such a strategy offers the opportunity of bringing us to a state where we can hope to predict biological processes and the effect of pharmaceutical agents upon them, and should both lower attrition and raise the rates of discovery of effective drugs substantially. © 2013 The Authors Journal compilation © 2013 FEBS.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most bioactive molecules perform their action by interacting with proteins or other macromolecules. However, for a significant fraction of them, the primary target remains unknown. In addition, the majority of bioactive molecules have more than one target, many of which are poorly characterized. Computational predictions of bioactive molecule targets based on similarity with known ligands are powerful to narrow down the number of potential targets and to rationalize side effects of known molecules.

RESULTS: Using a reference set of 224 412 molecules active on 1700 human proteins, we show that accurate target prediction can be achieved by combining different measures of chemical similarity based on both chemical structure and molecular shape. Our results indicate that the combined approach is especially efficient when no ligand with the same scaffold or from the same chemical series has yet been discovered. We also observe that different combinations of similarity measures are optimal for different molecular properties, such as the number of heavy atoms. This further highlights the importance of considering different classes of similarity measures between new molecules and known ligands to accurately predict their targets.

@article{Zerbe2012,
abstract = {In the context of protein-protein interactions, the term "hot spot" refers to a residue or cluster of residues that makes a major contribution to the binding free energy, as determined by alanine scanning mutagenesis. In contrast, in pharmaceutical research, a hot spot is a site on a target protein that has high propensity for ligand binding and hence is potentially important for drug discovery. Here we examine the relationship between these two hot spot concepts by comparing alanine scanning data for a set of 15 proteins with results from mapping the protein surfaces for sites that can bind fragment-sized small molecules. We find the two types of hot spots are largely complementary; the residues protruding into hot spot regions identified by computational mapping or experimental fragment screening are almost always themselves hot spot residues as defined by alanine scanning experiments. Conversely, a residue that is found by alanine scanning to contribute little to binding rarely interacts with hot spot regions on the partner protein identified by fragment mapping. In spite of the strong correlation between the two hot spot concepts, they fundamentally differ, however. In particular, while identification of a hot spot by alanine scanning establishes the potential to generate substantial interaction energy with a binding partner, there are additional topological requirements to be a hot spot for small molecule binding. Hence, only a minority of hot spots identified by alanine scanning represent sites that are potentially useful for small inhibitor binding, and it is this subset that is identified by experimental or computational fragment screening.},

@article{Sali1993,
abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

abstract = {In silico discovery of interactions between drug compounds and target proteins is of core importance for improving the efficiency of the laborious and costly experimental determination of drug-target interaction. Drug-target interaction data are available for many classes of pharmaceutically useful target proteins including enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors. However, current drug-target interaction databases contain a small number of drug-target pairs which are experimentally validated interactions. In particular, for some drug compounds (or targets) there is no available interaction. This motivates the need for developing methods that predict interacting pairs with high accuracy also for these 'new' drug compounds (or targets). We show that a simple weighted nearest neighbor procedure is highly effective for this task. We integrate this procedure into a recent machine learning method for drug-target interaction we developed in previous work. Results of experiments indicate that the resulting method predicts true interactions with high accuracy also for new drug compounds and achieves results comparable or better than those of recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

abstract = {There is a limited repertoire of domain families that are duplicated and combined in different ways to form the set of proteins in a genome. Proteins are gene products, and at the level of genes, duplication, recombination, fusion and fission are the processes that produce new genes. We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying the evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences of 40 genomes. The domain and superfamily definitions in the Structural Classification of Proteins Database are used, so that we can view all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their superfamily combinations. We find 783 out of the 859 superfamilies in SCOP in these genomes, and the 783 families occur in 1307 pairwise combinations. Most families are observed in combination with one or two other families, while a few families are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour; 209 families do not make combinations with other families. This type of pattern can be described as a scale-free network. We also study the N to C-terminal orientation of domain pairs and domain repeats. The phylogenetic distribution of domain combinations is surveyed, to establish the extent of common and kingdom-specific combinations. Of the kingdom-specific combinations, significantly more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms than of families present in one or two kingdoms. Hence, we are led to conclude that recombination between common families, as compared to the invention of new families and recombination among these, has also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom-specific and species-specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms. Finally, we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes to those in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and discuss the implications for structural genomics.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of network completion, which is to make the minimum amount of modifications to a given network so that the resulting network is most consistent with the observed data. We employ here a certain type of differential equations as gene regulation rules in a genetic network, gene expression time series data as observed data, and deletions and additions of edges as basic modification operations. In addition, we assume that the numbers of deleted and added edges are specified. For this problem, we present a novel method using dynamic programming and least-squares fitting and show that it outputs a network with the minimum sum squared error in polynomial time if the maximum indegree of the network is bounded by a constant. We also perform computational experiments using both artificially generated and real gene expression time series data.},

abstract = {The sigma-2 receptor, whose gene remains to be cloned, has been validated as a biomarker for tumour cell proliferation. Here we report the use of a novel photoaffinity probe, WC-21, to identify the sigma-2 receptor-binding site. WC-21, a sigma-2 ligand containing both a photoactive azide moiety and a fluorescein isothiocyanate group, irreversibly labels sigma-2 receptors in rat liver; the membrane-bound protein was identified as PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1). Immunocytochemistry reveals that both PGRMC1 and SW120, a fluorescent sigma-2 receptor ligand, colocalize with molecular markers of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in HeLa cells. Overexpression and knockdown of the PGRMC1 protein results in an increase and a decrease in binding of a sigma-2 selective radioligand, respectively. The identification of the putative sigma-2 receptor-binding site as PGRMC1 should stimulate the development of unique imaging agents and cancer therapeutics that target the sigma-2 receptor/PGRMC1 complex.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding their key roles in therapy and as biological probes, 7{\%} of approved drugs are purported to have no known primary target, and up to 18{\%} lack a well-defined mechanism of action. Using a chemoinformatics approach, we sought to "de-orphanize" drugs that lack primary targets. Surprisingly, targets could be easily predicted for many: Whereas these targets were not known to us nor to the common databases, most could be confirmed by literature search, leaving only 13 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with unknown targets; the number of drugs without molecular targets likely is far fewer than reported. The number of worldwide drugs without reasonable molecular targets similarly dropped, from 352 (25{\%}) to 44 (4{\%}). Nevertheless, there remained at least seven drugs for which reasonable mechanism-of-action targets were unknown but could be predicted, including the antitussives clemastine, cloperastine, and nepinalone; the antiemetic benzquinamide; the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine; the analgesic nefopam; and the immunomodulator lobenzarit. For each, predicted targets were confirmed experimentally, with affinities within their physiological concentration ranges. Turning this question on its head, we next asked which drugs were specific enough to act as chemical probes. Over 100 drugs met the standard criteria for probes, and 40 did so by more stringent criteria. A chemical information approach to drug-target association can guide therapeutic development and reveal applications to probe biology, a focus of much current interest.},

abstract = {The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins plays a key role in the process of genomic drug discovery. It is both consuming and costly to determine drug-target interactions by experiments alone. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new in silico prediction approaches capable of identifying these potential drug-target interactions in a timely manner. In this article, we aim at extending current structure-activity relationship (SAR) methodology to fulfill such requirements. In some sense, a drug-target interaction can be regarded as an event or property triggered by many influence factors from drugs and target proteins. Thus, each interaction pair can be represented theoretically by using these factors which are based on the structural and physicochemical properties simultaneously from drugs and proteins. To realize this, drug molecules are encoded with MACCS substructure fingerings representing existence of certain functional groups or fragments; and proteins are encoded with some biochemical and physicochemical properties. Four classes of drug-target interaction networks in humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors, are independently used for establishing predictive models with support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM models gave prediction accuracy of 90.31{\%}, 88.91{\%}, 84.68{\%} and 83.74{\%} for four datasets, respectively. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method to predict the drug-target interactions, and show a general compatibility between the new scheme and current SAR methodology. They open the way to a host of new investigations on the diversity analysis and prediction of drug-target interactions.},

Allosteric signal propagation does not stop at the 'end' of a protein, but may be dynamically transmitted across the cell. We propose here that the concept of allosteric drugs can be broadened to 'allo-network drugs' - whose effects can propagate either within a protein, or across several proteins, to enhance or inhibit specific interactions along a pathway. We posit that current allosteric drugs are a special case of allo-network drugs, and suggest that allo-network drugs can achieve specific, limited changes at the systems level, and in this way can achieve fewer side effects and lower toxicity. Finally, we propose steps and methods to identify allo-network drug targets and sites that outline a new paradigm in systems-based drug design.},

Therefore, there is a great effort in developing drugs modulating autophagy, and various approaches have been taken towards this goal. Gene expression has been considered an important biomarker for drug activity for prediction of drug mode of action. However, the lack of efficient method of analysis has hampered recognition of drug mode of action based on the analysis of gene expression profiles. A novel and robust tool for prediction of drug mode of action and drug repositioning overcomes the limitations of previously available methods. This novel tool is based on a data set of expression profiles derived from a large number of drugs integrated into a "drug network" constructed by comparing the transcriptional responses induced in human cell lines. Automatic analysis of the topology of the drug network makes it possible to classify compounds and to predict unreported effects of well-known drugs. Using this tool, it was possible to identify fasudil as a new enhancer of autophagy.},

Development of an integrated approach for systematic discovering drug-disease associations by those informational data is an important issue.

METHODS: We combine three different networks of drug, genomic and disease phenotype and assign the weights to the edges from available experimental data and knowledge. Given a specific disease, we use our network propagation approach to infer the drug-disease associations.

RESULTS: We apply prostate cancer and colorectal cancer as our test data. We use the manually curated drug-disease associations from comparative toxicogenomics database to be our benchmark. The ranked results show that our proposed method obtains higher specificity and sensitivity and clearly outperforms previous methods. Our result also show that our method with off-targets information gets higher performance than that with only primary drug targets in both test data.

CONCLUSIONS: We clearly demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of using network-based analyses of chemical, genomic and phenotype data to reveal drug-disease associations. The potential associations inferred by our method provide new perspectives for toxicogenomics and drug reposition evaluation.},

abstract = {BioLiP (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BioLiP/) is a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand-protein interactions. Establishing interactions between protein and biologically relevant ligands is an important step toward understanding the protein functions. Most ligand-binding sites prediction methods use the protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates. However, not all ligands present in the PDB are biologically relevant, as small molecules are often used as additives for solving the protein structures. To facilitate template-based ligand-protein docking, virtual ligand screening and protein function annotations, we develop a hierarchical procedure for assessing the biological relevance of ligands present in the PDB structures, which involves a four-step biological feature filtering followed by careful manual verifications. This procedure is used for BioLiP construction. Each entry in BioLiP contains annotations on: ligand-binding residues, ligand-binding affinity, catalytic sites, Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and cross-links to the other databases. In addition, to facilitate the use of BioLiP for function annotation of uncharacterized proteins, a new consensus-based algorithm COACH is developed to predict ligand-binding sites from protein sequence or using 3D structure. The BioLiP database is updated weekly and the current release contains 204 223 entries.},

abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays important roles in digestion and resistance against entero-pathogens. As with other ecosystems, its species composition is resilient against small disturbances but strong perturbations such as antibiotics can affect the consortium dramatically. Antibiotic cessation does not necessarily restore pre-treatment conditions and disturbed microbiota are often susceptible to pathogen invasion. Here we propose a mathematical model to explain how antibiotic-mediated switches in the microbiota composition can result from simple social interactions between antibiotic-tolerant and antibiotic-sensitive bacterial groups. We build a two-species (e.g. two functional-groups) model and identify regions of domination by antibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, as well as a region of multistability where domination by either group is possible. Using a new framework that we derived from statistical physics, we calculate the duration of each microbiota composition state. This is shown to depend on the balance between random fluctuations in the bacterial densities and the strength of microbial interactions. The singular value decomposition of recent metagenomic data confirms our assumption of grouping microbes as antibiotic-tolerant or antibiotic-sensitive in response to a single antibiotic. Our methodology can be extended to multiple bacterial groups and thus it provides an ecological formalism to help interpret the present surge in microbiome data.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo simulation method for globular proteins, called extended-scaled-collective-variable (ESCV) Monte Carlo, is proposed. This method combines two Monte Carlo algorithms known as entropy-sampling and scaled-collective-variable algorithms. Entropy-sampling Monte Carlo is able to sample a large configurational space even in a disordered system that has a large number of potential barriers. In contrast, scaled-collective-variable Monte Carlo provides an efficient sampling for a system whose dynamics is highly cooperative. Because a globular protein is a disordered system whose dynamics is characterized by collective motions, a combination of these two algorithms could provide an optimal Monte Carlo simulation for a globular protein. As a test case, we have carried out an ESCV Monte Carlo simulation for a cell adhesive Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide, Lys-Arg-Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Cys-Met-Asp, and determined the conformational distribution at 300 K. The peptide contains a disulfide bridge between the two cysteine residues. This bond mimics the strong geometrical constraints that result from a protein's globular nature and give rise to highly cooperative dynamics. Computation results show that the ESCV Monte Carlo was not trapped at any local minimum and that the canonical distribution was correctly determined. },

abstract = {This chapter investigates the anatomy and taxonomy of protein structures. A protein is a polypeptide chain made up of amino acid residues linked together in a definite sequence. Amino acids are “handed,” and naturally occurring proteins contain only L-amino acids. A simple mnemonic for that purpose is the “corncrib.” The sequence of side chains determines all that is unique about a particular protein, including its biological function and its specific three-dimensional structure. The major possible routes to knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure are prediction from the amino acid sequence and analysis of spectroscopic measurements such as circular dichroism, laser Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The analysis and discussion of protein structure is based on the results of three-dimensional X-ray crystallography of globular proteins. The basic elements of protein structures are discussed. The most useful level at which protein structures are to be categorized is the domain, as there are many cases of multiple-domain proteins in which each separate domain resembles other entire smaller proteins. The simplest type of stable protein structure consists of polypeptide backbone wrapped more or less uniformly around the outside of a single hydrophobic core. The outline of the taxonomy is also provided in the chapter.},

abstract = {Of the ∼4000 ORFs identified through the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) H37Rv, experimentally determined structures are available for 312. Since knowledge of protein structures is essential to obtain a high-resolution understanding of the underlying biology, we seek to obtain a structural annotation for the genome, using computational methods. Structural models were obtained and validated for ∼2877 ORFs, covering ∼70{\%} of the genome. Functional annotation of each protein was based on fold-based functional assignments and a novel binding site based ligand association. New algorithms for binding site detection and genome scale binding site comparison at the structural level, recently reported from the laboratory, were utilized. Besides these, the annotation covers detection of various sequence and sub-structural motifs and quaternary structure predictions based on the corresponding templates. The study provides an opportunity to obtain a global perspective of the fold distribution in the genome. The annotation indicates that cellular metabolism can be achieved with only 219 folds. New insights about the folds that predominate in the genome, as well as the fold-combinations that make up multi-domain proteins are also obtained. 1728 binding pockets have been associated with ligands through binding site identification and sub-structure similarity analyses. The resource (http://proline.physics.iisc.ernet.in/Tbstructuralannotation), being one of the first to be based on structure-derived functional annotations at a genome scale, is expected to be useful for better understanding of TB and for application in drug discovery. The reported annotation pipeline is fairly generic and can be applied to other genomes as well.},

abstract = {Computational prediction of interactions between drugs and their target proteins is of great importance for drug discovery and design. The difficulties of developing computational methods for the prediction of such potential interactions lie in the rarity of known drug-protein interactions and no experimentally verified negative drug-target interaction sample. Furthermore, target proteins need also to be predicted for some new drugs without any known target interaction information. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning method NetCBP is presented to address this problem by using labeled and unlabeled interaction information. Assuming coherent interactions between the drugs ranked by their relevance to a query drug, and the target proteins ranked by their relevance to the hidden target proteins of the query drug, we formulate a learning framework maximizing the rank coherence with respect to the known drug-target interactions. When applied to four classes of important drug-target interaction networks, our method improves previous methods in terms of cross-validation and some strongly predicted interactions are confirmed by the publicly accessible drug target databases, which indicates the usefulness of our method. Finally, a comprehensive prediction of drug-target interactions enables us to suggest many new potential drug-target interactions for further studies.},

COFACTOR was tested on 501 proteins, which harbor 582 natural and drug-like ligand molecules. Starting from I-TASSER structure predictions, the method successfully identifies ligand-binding pocket locations for 65{\%} of apo receptors with an average distance error 2 {\AA}. The average precision of binding-residue assignments is 46{\%} and 137{\%} higher than that by FINDSITE and ConCavity. In CASP9, COFACTOR achieved a binding-site prediction precision 72{\%} and Matthews correlation coefficient 0.69 for 31 blind test proteins, which was significantly higher than all other participating methods. These data demonstrate the power of structure-based approaches to protein-ligand interaction predictions applicable for genome-wide structural and functional annotations.},

We investigated pancreatic cancer progression by utilizing a mathematical framework of metastasis formation together with comprehensive data of 228 patients, 101 of whom had autopsies. We found that pancreatic cancer growth is initially exponential. After estimating the rates of pancreatic cancer growth and dissemination, we determined that patients likely harbor metastases at diagnosis and predicted the number and size distribution of metastases as well as patient survival. These findings were validated in an independent database. Finally, we analyzed the effects of different treatment modalities, finding that therapies that efficiently reduce the growth rate of cells earlier in the course of treatment appear to be superior to upfront tumor resection. These predictions can be validated in the clinic. Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the dynamics of pancreatic cancer metastasis and identifies optimum therapeutic interventions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is a constitutively active receptor that can sequester G(i/o)-proteins and prevent other G(i/o)-coupled receptors from signaling (Bouaboula et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1998; Vasquez and Lewis, 1999). G-protein sequestration occurs because the population of CB1 cannabinoid receptors exists in both an inactive G-protein-precoupled RG(GDP) state and a constitutively active R*G(GTP) state. We tested the hypothesis that the distal C-terminal tail acts to prevent G-protein activation. We found that truncation of the distal C-terminal tail of the CB1 receptor (CB1-417) enhanced both the constitutive activity and the ability of the receptor to sequester G-proteins. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the conserved aspartate (D2.50) in the second transmembrane domain of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor is crucial for constitutive activity and G-protein sequestration. We found that the mutation of aspartate to asparagine (CB1-D164N) abolished G-protein sequestration and constitutive receptor activity without disrupting agonist-stimulated activity. We conclude that the CB1-D164N mutation and the C-terminal truncation shift the population of receptors in opposite directions. The CB1-D164N mutation shifts the receptor into an inactive R state upcoupled from G-proteins, whereas the C-terminal truncation (CB1-417) shifts the receptor into the active R*G(GTP) state. Thus the distal C-terminal tail acts to constrain the receptor from activating G-proteins, whereas the aspartate (D2.50) in the second transmembrane domain stabilizes the receptor in both the inactive RG(GDP) state and the active R*G(GTP) state.},

Here, we combine genome-scale maps of regulatory DNA marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 138 cell and tissue types with whole-genome sequences of 53 geographically diverse individuals in order to better delimit the patterns of regulatory variation in humans. We estimate that individuals likely harbor many more functionally important variants in regulatory DNA compared with protein-coding regions, although they are likely to have, on average, smaller effect sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is significant heterogeneity in the level of functional constraint in regulatory DNA among different cell types. We also find marked variability in functional constraint among transcription factor motifs in regulatory DNA, with sequence motifs for major developmental regulators, such as HOX proteins, exhibiting levels of constraint comparable to protein-coding regions. Finally, we perform a genome-wide scan of recent positive selection and identify hundreds of novel substrates of adaptive regulatory evolution that are enriched for biologically interesting pathways such as melanogenesis and adipocytokine signaling. These data and results provide new insights into patterns of regulatory variation in individuals and populations and demonstrate that a large proportion of functionally important variation lies beyond the exome.},

However, the information usually resides in unwieldy databases, limiting ready data analysis and integration. One resource that offers substantial potential for improvement in this regard is the NCI-60 cell line database compiled by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which has been extensively characterized across numerous genomic and pharmacologic response platforms. In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for 20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clarified data organization and cross-comparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can be conducted in an iterative manner specific to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identification of colon-specific genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug identification patterns matched to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib. CellMiner greatly broadens applications of the extensive NCI-60 database for discovery by creating web-based processes that are rapid, flexible, and readily applied by users without bioinformatics expertise.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) represents a costly and time consuming step in the drug discovery and design. Computational methods capable to predict reliable DTI play an important role in the field. Recently recommendation methods relying on Network Based Inference (NBI) have been proposed. However, such approaches implement naive topology based inference and do not take into account important features within the drug-target domain. RESULTS: In this paper we present a new Network Based Inference method, called Domain Tuned-Hybrid (DT-Hybrid), which extends a well establish recommendation technique by domain-based knowledge including drugs and targets similarity. DT-Hybrid has been extensively tested using the last version of experimentally validated drug-target interaction database obtained from DrugBank. Comparison with other recently proposed NBI methods clearly show that DT-Hybrid is capable of predicting more reliable drug-target interactions. AVAILABILITY: DT-Hybrid has been developed in R, and is available, along with all the results on the predictions, through an R package at the following url http://sites.google.com/site/ehybridalgo/ CONTACT: apulvirenti@dmi.unict.it.},

Each process leaves a characteristic imprint - a mutational signature - on the cancer genome, which is defined by the type of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that result in base substitutions, insertions and deletions or structural variations. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, researchers are identifying an increasing array of these signatures. Mutational signatures can be used as a physiological readout of the biological history of a cancer and also have potential use for discerning ongoing mutational processes from historical ones, thus possibly revealing new targets for anticancer therapies.},

abstract = {Detection of remote binding site similarity in proteins plays an important role for drug repositioning and off-target effect prediction. Various non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van-der-Waals forces drive ligands' molecular recognition by binding sites in proteins. The increasing amount of available structures of protein-small molecule complexes enabled the development of comparative approaches. Several methods have been developed to characterize and compare protein-ligand interaction patterns. Usually implemented as fingerprints, these are mainly used for post processing docking scores and (off-)target prediction. In the latter application, interaction profiles detect similarities in the bound interactions of different ligands and thus identify essential interactions between a protein and its small molecule ligands. Interaction pattern similarity correlates with binding site similarity and is thus contributing to a higher precision in binding site similarity assessment of proteins with distinct global structure. This renders it valuable for existing drug repositioning approaches in structural bioinformatics. Current methods to characterize and compare structure-based interaction patterns - both for protein-small-molecule and protein-protein interactions - as well as their potential in target prediction will be reviewed in this article. The question of how the set of interaction types, flexibility or water-mediated interactions, influence the comparison of interaction patterns will be discussed. Due to the wealth of protein-ligand structures available today, predicted targets can be ranked by comparing their ligand interaction pattern to patterns of the known target. Such knowledge-based methods offer high precision in comparison to methods comparing whole binding sites based on shape and amino acid physicochemical similarity.},

abstract = {In silico prediction of drug-target interactions from heterogeneous biological data can advance our system-level search for drug molecules and therapeutic targets, which efforts have not yet reached full fruition. In this work, we report a systematic approach that efficiently integrates the chemical, genomic, and pharmacological information for drug targeting and discovery on a large scale, based on two powerful methods of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the derived models was evaluated and verified with internally five-fold cross-validation and four external independent validations. The optimal models show impressive performance of prediction for drug-target interactions, with a concordance of 82.83{\%}, a sensitivity of 81.33{\%}, and a specificity of 93.62{\%}, respectively. The consistence of the performances of the RF and SVM models demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the obtained models. In addition, the validated models were employed to systematically predict known/unknown drugs and targets involving the enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs, and nuclear receptors, which can be further mapped to functional ontologies such as target-disease associations and target-target interaction networks. This approach is expected to help fill the existing gap between chemical genomics and network pharmacology and thus accelerate the drug discovery processes.},

@article{Yun2008,
abstract = {Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the efficacy of these agents is often limited because of the emergence of drug resistance conferred by a second mutation, T790M. Threonine 790 is the "gatekeeper" residue, an important determinant of inhibitor specificity in the ATP binding pocket. The T790M mutation has been thought to cause resistance by sterically blocking binding of TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, but this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that it remains sensitive to structurally similar irreversible inhibitors. Here, we show by using a direct binding assay that T790M mutants retain low-nanomolar affinity for gefitinib. Furthermore, we show that the T790M mutation activates WT EGFR and that introduction of the T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the oncogenic L858R mutant by more than an order of magnitude. The increased ATP affinity is the primary mechanism by which the T790M mutation confers drug resistance. Crystallographic analysis of the T790M mutant shows how it can adapt to accommodate tight binding of diverse inhibitors, including the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272, and also suggests a structural mechanism for catalytic activation. We conclude that the T790M mutation is a "generic" resistance mutation that will reduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and that irreversible inhibitors overcome this resistance simply through covalent binding, not as a result of an alternative binding mode.},

abstract = {We present a formalism to compute the probability of an amino acid sequence conformation being native-like, given a set of pairwise atom-atom distances. The formalism is used to derive three discriminatory functions with different types of representations for the atom-atom contacts observed in a database of protein structures. These functions include two virtual atom representations and one all-heavy atom representation. When applied to six different decoy sets containing a range of correct and incorrect conformations of amino acid sequences, the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function is able to identify correct from incorrect more often than the discriminatory functions using approximate representations. We illustrate the importance of using a detailed atomic description for obtaining the most accurate discrimination, and the necessity for testing discriminatory functions against a wide variety of decoys. The discriminatory function is also shown to be capable of capturing the fine details of atom-atom preferences. These results suggest that the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function will be useful for protein structure prediction and model refinement.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutations play fundamental roles in evolution by introducing diversity into genomes. Missense mutations in structural genes may become either selectively advantageous or disadvantageous to the organism by affecting protein stability and/or interfering with interactions between partners. Thus, the ability to predict the impact of mutations on protein stability and interactions is of significant value, particularly in understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic mutations on the progression of disease. Here, we propose a novel approach to the study of missense mutations, called mCSM, which relies on graph-based signatures. These encode distance patterns between atoms and are used to represent the protein residue environment and to train predictive models. To understand the roles of mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on protein stability but also on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions.

RESULTS: We show that mCSM performs as well as or better than other methods that are used widely. The mCSM signatures were successfully used in different tasks demonstrating that the impact of a mutation can be correlated with the atomic-distance patterns surrounding an amino acid residue. We showed that mCSM can predict stability changes of a wide range of mutations occurring in the tumour suppressor protein p53, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method in a challenging disease scenario.Availability and implementation: A web server is available at http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/mcsm.

Better understanding of how the protein universe evolved to its present form can be achieved by creating models of protein structure evolution. Here we introduce a stochastic model of evolution that involves residue substitutions as the sole source of structure innovation, and is nonetheless able to reproduce the diversity of the protein domains repertoire, its cluster structure with heavy-tailed distribution of family sizes, and presence of the twilight zone populated with remote homologs.},

abstract = {Marketed drugs frequently perform worse in clinical practice than in the clinical trials on which their approval is based. Many therapeutic compounds are ineffective for a large subpopulation of patients to whom they are prescribed; worse, a significant fraction of patients experience adverse effects more severe than anticipated. The unacceptable risk-benefit profile for many drugs mandates a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine. However, prior to adoption of patient-specific approaches, it is useful to understand the molecular details underlying variable drug response among diverse patient populations. Over the past decade, progress in structural genomics led to an explosion of available three-dimensional structures of drug target proteins while efforts in pharmacogenetics offered insights into polymorphisms correlated with differential therapeutic outcomes. Together these advances provide the opportunity to examine how altered protein structures arising from genetic differences affect protein-drug interactions and, ultimately, drug response. In this review, we first summarize structural characteristics of protein targets and common mechanisms of drug interactions. Next, we describe the impact of coding mutations on protein structures and drug response. Finally, we highlight tools for analysing protein structures and protein-drug interactions and discuss their application for understanding altered drug responses associated with protein structural variants.},

abstract = {Bioinformatics and chemoinformatics approaches contribute to hit discovery, hit-to-lead optimization, safety profiling, and target identification and enhance our overall understanding of the health and disease states. A vast repertoire of computational methods has been reported and increasingly combined in order to address more and more challenging targets or complex molecular mechanisms in the context of large-scale integration of structure and bioactivity data produced by private and public drug research. This review explores some key computational methods directly linked to drug discovery and chemical biology with a special emphasis on compound collection preparation, virtual screening, protein docking, and systems pharmacology. A list of generally freely available software packages and online resources is provided, and examples of successful applications are briefly commented upon.},

abstract = {FireDB (http://firedb.bioinfo.cnio.es) is a curated inventory of catalytic and biologically relevant small ligand-binding residues culled from the protein structures in the Protein Data Bank. Here we present the important new additions since the publication of FireDB in 2007. The database now contains an extensive list of manually curated biologically relevant compounds. Biologically relevant compounds are informative because of their role in protein function, but they are only a small fraction of the entire ligand set. For the remaining ligands, the FireDB provides cross-references to the annotations from publicly available biological, chemical and pharmacological compound databases. FireDB now has external references for 95{\%} of contacting small ligands, making FireDB a more complete database and providing the scientific community with easy access to the pharmacological annotations of PDB ligands. In addition to the manual curation of ligands, FireDB also provides insights into the biological relevance of individual binding sites. Here, biological relevance is calculated from the multiple sequence alignments of related binding sites that are generated from all-against-all comparison of each FireDB binding site. The database can be accessed by RESTful web services and is available for download via MySQL.},

A common approach has so far been to cover as much of the chemical space as possible by screening a chemically diverse set of compounds. We show that, rather than chemical diversity, the biologic diversity of a compound library is an essential requirement for hit identification. We describe a simple and efficient approach for the design of a HTS library based on compound-target diversity. Biodiverse compound subsets outperform chemically diverse libraries regarding hit rate and the total number of unique chemical scaffolds present among hits. Specifically, by screening ∼19{\%} of a HTS collection, we expect to discover ∼50-80{\%} of all desired bioactive compounds.},

The advances in Systems Biology have been absolutely decisive for drug discovery, as iterative rounds of predictions made from in silico models followed by selected experimental validations have resulted in a substantial saving of time and investments. Many diseases have their origins in proteins that are not located in the cytosol but in intracellular compartments (i.e. mitochondria, lysosome, peroxisome and others) or cell membranes. In these cases, biocomputational approaches present limitations to their study. In the present work, we review them and propose new initiatives to advance towards a safer, more efficient and personalized pharmacology. This focus could be especially useful for drug discovery and the reposition of known drugs in rare and emergent diseases associated with compartmentalized proteins.},

Here we consider thousands of chemicals and analyse the relationship of their structures with adverse and therapeutic responses. Our study includes molecules related to the aetiology of 934 health-threatening conditions and used to treat 835 diseases. We first identify chemical moieties that could be independently associated with each phenotypic effect. Using these fragments, we build accurate predictors for approximately 400 clinical phenotypes, finding many privileged and liable structures. Finally, we connect two diseases if they relate to similar chemical structures. The resulting networks of human conditions are able to predict disease comorbidities, as well as identifying potential drug side effects and opportunities for drug repositioning, and show a remarkable coincidence with clinical observations.},

A detailed comparison of a large number of similarity coefficients demonstrates that the well-known Tanimoto coefficient remains the method of choice for the computation of fingerprint-based similarity, despite possessing some inherent biases related to the sizes of the molecules that are being sought. Group fusion involves combining the results of similarity searches based on multiple reference structures and a single similarity measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to screening, and also describe an approximate form of group fusion, turbo similarity searching, that can be used when just a single reference structure is available.},

@article{DiazJr2012a,
abstract = {Colorectal tumours that are wild type for KRAS are often sensitive to EGFR blockade, but almost always develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. The mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies are largely unknown. This situation is in marked contrast to that of small-molecule targeted agents, such as inhibitors of ABL, EGFR, BRAF and MEK, in which mutations in the genes encoding the protein targets render the tumours resistant to the effects of the drugs. The simplest hypothesis to account for the development of resistance to EGFR blockade is that rare cells with KRAS mutations pre-exist at low levels in tumours with ostensibly wild-type KRAS genes. Although this hypothesis would seem readily testable, there is no evidence in pre-clinical models to support it, nor is there data from patients. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected in the circulation of 28 patients receiving monotherapy with panitumumab, a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody. We found that 9 out of 24 (38{\%}) patients whose tumours were initially KRAS wild type developed detectable mutations in KRAS in their sera, three of which developed multiple different KRAS mutations. The appearance of these mutations was very consistent, generally occurring between 5 and 6 months following treatment. Mathematical modelling indicated that the mutations were present in expanded subclones before the initiation of panitumumab treatment. These results suggest that the emergence of KRAS mutations is a mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade and that these mutations can be detected in a non-invasive manner. They explain why solid tumours develop resistance to targeted therapies in a highly reproducible fashion.},

abstract = {Nearly 50{\%} of human malignancies exhibit unregulated RAS-ERK signaling; inhibiting it is a valid strategy for antineoplastic intervention. Upon activation, ERK dimerize, which is essential for ERK extranuclear, but not for nuclear, signaling. Here, we describe a small molecule inhibitor for ERK dimerization that, without affecting ERK phosphorylation, forestalls tumorigenesis driven by RAS-ERK pathway oncogenes. This compound is unaffected by resistance mechanisms that hamper classical RAS-ERK pathway inhibitors. Thus, ERK dimerization inhibitors provide the proof of principle for two understudied concepts in cancer therapy: (1) the blockade of sub-localization-specific sub-signals, rather than total signals, as a means of impeding oncogenic RAS-ERK signaling and (2) targeting regulatory protein-protein interactions, rather than catalytic activities, as an approach for producing effective antitumor agents. Herrero et al. identify a small molecule inhibitor of ERK dimerization that impedes the growth of tumor cells dependent on a hyperactivated RAS-ERK pathway. Importantly, the antitumor effect of this compound in cells is not affected by the reported resistance mechanisms for the current BRAF and MEK inhibitors.},

Structure-based target druggability assessment consists of predicting ligand-binding sites on the protein that are complementary to these drug-like properties. Automated identification of ligand-binding sites can use geometrical considerations alone or include specific physicochemical properties of the protein surface. Features of a pocket's size and shape, together with measures of its hydrophobicity, are most informative in identifying suitable drug-binding pockets. The recent availability of several validation sets of druggable versus undruggable targets has helped fuel the development of more elaborate methods.},

The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for analysing the outputs of molecular docking, which in turn is an important technique for drug discovery, chemical biology and structural biology. Each scoring function assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex, which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation data and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions. Moreover, resampling strategies, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter estimation for scoring functions.},

Network-based analysis of expression profiles from in vivo treatment of GEM models identified drugs and drug combinations that inhibit the activity of FOXM1 and CENPF, which are master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Validation of mouse and human prostate cancer models confirmed the specificity and synergy of a predicted drug combination to abrogate FOXM1/CENPF activity and inhibit tumorigenicity. Network-based analysis of treatment signatures from GEM models identified treatment-responsive genes in human prostate cancer that are potential biomarkers of patient response. More generally, this approach allows systematic identification of drugs that inhibit tumor dependencies, thereby improving the utility of GEM models for prioritizing drugs for clinical evaluation.},

abstract = {Adverse drug reactions (ADR), also known as side-effects, are complex undesired physiologic phenomena observed secondary to the administration of pharmaceuticals. Several phenomena underlie the emergence of each ADR; however, a dominant factor is the drug's ability to modulate one or more biological pathways. Understanding the biological processes behind the occurrence of ADRs would lead to the development of safer and more effective drugs. At present, no method exists to discover these ADR-pathway associations. In this paper we introduce a computational framework for identifying a subset of these associations based on the assumption that drugs capable of modulating the same pathway may induce similar ADRs. Our model exploits multiple information resources. First, we utilize a publicly available dataset pairing drugs with their observed ADRs. Second, we identify putative protein targets for each drug using the protein structure database and in-silico virtual docking. Third, we label each protein target with its known involvement in one or more biological pathways. Finally, the relationships among these information sources are mined using multiple stages of logistic-regression while controlling for over-fitting and multiple-hypothesis testing. As proof-of-concept, we examined a dataset of 506 ADRs, 730 drugs, and 830 human protein targets. Our method yielded 185 ADR-pathway associations of which 45 were selected to undergo a manual literature review. We found 32 associations to be supported by the scientific literature.},

abstract = {Protein structure homology modelling has become a routine technique to generate 3D models for proteins when experimental structures are not available. Fully automated servers such as SWISS-MODEL with user-friendly web interfaces generate reliable models without the need for complex software packages or downloading large databases. Here, we describe the latest version of the SWISS-MODEL expert system for protein structure modelling. The SWISS-MODEL template library provides annotation of quaternary structure and essential ligands and co-factors to allow for building of complete structural models, including their oligomeric structure. The improved SWISS-MODEL pipeline makes extensive use of model quality estimation for selection of the most suitable templates and provides estimates of the expected accuracy of the resulting models. The accuracy of the models generated by SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated by the CAMEO system. The new web site allows users to interactively search for templates, cluster them by sequence similarity, structurally compare alternative templates and select the ones to be used for model building. In cases where multiple alternative template structures are available for a protein of interest, a user-guided template selection step allows building models in different functional states. SWISS-MODEL is available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/. },

We present a local three-dimensional method that compares protein binding site surfaces in full atomic detail. The approach is based on the morphological similarity method which has been widely applied for global comparison of small molecules. We apply the method to all-by-all comparisons two sets of human protein kinases, a very diverse set of ATP-bound proteins from multiple species, and three heterogeneous benchmark protein binding site data sets. Cases of disagreement between sequence-based similarity and binding site similarity yield informative examples. Where sequence similarity is very low, high pocket similarity can reliably identify important binding motifs. Where sequence similarity is very high, significant differences in pocket similarity are related to ligand binding specificity and similarity. Local protein binding pocket similarity provides qualitatively complementary information to other approaches, and it can yield quantitative information in support of functional annotation.},

abstract = {Identification of possible protein targets of small chemical molecules is an important step for unravelling their underlying causes of actions at the molecular level. To this end, we construct a web server, idTarget, which can predict possible binding targets of a small chemical molecule via a divide-and-conquer docking approach, in combination with our recently developed scoring functions based on robust regression analysis and quantum chemical charge models. Affinity profiles of the protein targets are used to provide the confidence levels of prediction. The divide-and-conquer docking approach uses adaptively constructed small overlapping grids to constrain the searching space, thereby achieving better docking efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that screen against a specific class of targets or a limited number of targets, idTarget screen against nearly all protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We show that idTarget is able to reproduce known off-targets of drugs or drug-like compounds, and the suggested new targets could be prioritized for further investigation. idTarget is freely available as a web-based server at http://idtarget.rcas.sinica.edu.tw.},

Existing databases of ligand-binding sites offer databases of limited scale. For example, SitesBase covers only {\~{}}33,000 known binding sites. Inferring protein function and drug discovery purposes, however, demands a much more comprehensive database including known and putative-binding sites. Using a novel algorithm, we conducted a large-scale all-pairs similarity search for 1.8 million known and potential binding sites in the PDB, and discovered over 14 million similar pairs of binding sites. Here, we present the results as a relational database Pocket Similarity Search using Multiple-sketches (PoSSuM) including all the discovered pairs with annotations of various types. PoSSuM enables rapid exploration of similar binding sites among structures with different global folds as well as similar ones. Moreover, PoSSuM is useful for predicting the binding ligand for unbound structures, which provides important clues for characterizing protein structures with unclear functions.

However, current cancer therapy predominantly relies on the reductionist approach of one gene-one disease. Combinations of drugs may overcome drug resistance by limiting mutations and induction of escape pathways, but given the enormous number of possible drug combinations, strategies to reduce the search space and prioritize experiments are needed. In this review, we focus on the use of computational modeling, bioinformatics and high-throughput experimental methods for discovery of drug combinations. We highlight cutting-edge systems approaches, including large-scale modeling of cell signaling networks, network motif analysis, statistical association-based models, identifying correlations in gene signatures, functional genomics, and high-throughput combination screens. We also present a list of publicly available data and resources to aid in discovery of drug combinations.

Many studies have shown the potential of $\sigma$(1) receptor ligands for the treatment of various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS); nevertheless, almost no information about the 3D structure of the receptor and/or the possible modes of interaction of the $\sigma$(1) protein with its ligands have been unveiled so far. With the present work we validated our $\sigma$(1) 3D homology model and assessed its reliability as a platform for $\sigma$(1) ligand structure-based drug design. To this purpose, the 3D $\sigma$(1) model was exploited in the design of 33 new $\sigma$(1) ligands and in their ranking for receptor affinity by extensive molecular dynamics simulation-based free energy calculations. Also, the main interactions involved in receptor/ligand binding were analyzed by applying a per residue free energy deconvolution and in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis calculations. Subsequently, all compounds were synthesized in our laboratory and tested for $\sigma$(1) binding activity in vitro. The agreement between in silico and in vitro results confirms the reliability of the proposed $\sigma$(1) 3D model in the a priori prediction of the affinity of new $\sigma$(1) ligands. Moreover, it also supports and corroborates the currently available biochemical data concerning the $\sigma$(1) protein residues considered essential for $\sigma$(1) ligand binding and activity.},

However, the field remains far from reaching a technological plateau, as both computational techniques and nucleotide sequencing platforms for microbial genomic and transcriptional content continue to improve. Current microbiome analyses are thus starting to adopt multiple and complementary meta'omic approaches, leading to unprecedented opportunities to comprehensively and accurately characterize microbial communities and their interactions with their environments and hosts. This diversity of available assays, analysis methods, and public data is in turn beginning to enable microbiome-based predictive and modeling tools.

Using the AM1 molecular orbital method, conformational analysis of 1 around the pyrazole C3 substituent identified four distinct conformations designated Tg, Ts, Cg, and Cs. The energetic stability of these conformers followed the order Tg > Cg > Ts > Cs for the neutral (unprotonated) form of 1 and Ts > Tg > Cs > Cg for its piperidine N-protonated form. Unified pharmacophore models for the CB1 receptor ligands were developed by incorporating the protonated form of 1 into the superimposition model for the cannabinoid agonists 4-[4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-hydroxyphenyl]perhydro-2alpha,6beta-dihydroxynaphthalene (CP55244; 2) and the protonated form of (R)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthalenyl)methanone (WIN55212-2; 3) reported previously (Shim et al. In Rational Drug Design Symposium Series; Parrill, A. L., Reddy, M. R., Eds.; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1999; pp 165-184). Values of K(i) for 1 and a series of 31 structural analogues were determined from radioligand binding analyses by competitive displacement of [3H]CP55940 from cannabinoid receptors in a rat brain membrane preparation. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was employed to construct three-dimensional (3D)-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for this data set as unprotonated species assuming the Tg, Cg, and Ts conformers and for the protonated species assuming the Ts, Tg, and Cs conformers. Values of the conventional r2 and cross-validated r2 (r(cv)2) associated with these CoMFA models exceeded the threshold for statistical robustness (r2 > or = 0.90) and internal predictive ability (r(cv)2 > or = 0.50) in each of these six cases except for the protonated species assuming the Tg conformer (i.e., r2 = 0.97; r(cv)2 = 0.36). Results from conformational analyses, superimposition models, and 3D-QSAR models suggest that the N1 aromatic ring moiety of 1 dominates the steric binding interaction with the receptor in much the same way as does the C3 alkyl side chain of cannabinoid agonists and the C3 aroyl ring of the aminoalkylindole agonists. We also determined that several of the conformers considered in this study possess the proper spatial orientation and distinct electrostatic character to bind to the CB1 receptor. We propose that the unique region in space occupied by the C5 aromatic ring of 1 might contribute to conferring antagonist activity. We further propose that the pyrazole C3 substituent of 1 might contribute to conferring either neutral antagonist or inverse agonist activity, depending upon the interaction with the receptor.},

The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the CHARMM-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30{\%} of 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loop predictions, respectively, had <2 A RMSD error for the mainchain N, C(alpha), C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 +/- 0.05, 1.16 +/- 0.10, and 2.61 +/- 0.16 A, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the RMSD distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 A, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3{\%} for 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

abstract = {To better understand the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of human disease, we systematically examine relationships between 3,949 genes, 62,663 mutations and 3,453 associated disorders by generating a three-dimensional, structurally resolved human interactome. This network consists of 4,222 high-quality binary protein-protein interactions with their atomic-resolution interfaces. We find that in-frame mutations (missense point mutations and in-frame insertions and deletions) are enriched on the interaction interfaces of proteins associated with the corresponding disorders, and that the disease specificity for different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their location within an interface. We also predict 292 candidate genes for 694 unknown disease-to-gene associations with proposed molecular mechanism hypotheses. This work indicates that knowledge of how in-frame disease mutations alter specific interactions is critical to understanding pathogenesis. Structurally resolved interaction networks should be valuable tools for interpreting the wealth of data being generated by large-scale structural genomics and disease association studies.},

abstract = {To explore the hydrophobic binding region of the $\sigma$(1) receptor protein, regioisomeric spirocyclic thiophenes 9-11 were developed as versatile building blocks. Regioselective $\alpha$- and $\beta$-arylation using the catalyst systems PdCl(2)/bipy/Ag(2)CO(3) and PdCl(2)/P[OCH(CF(3))(2)](3)/Ag(2)CO(3) allowed the introduction of various aryl moieties at different positions in the last step of the synthesis. The increasing $\sigma$(1) affinity in the order 4 < 5/6 < 7/8 indicates that the positions of the additional aryl moiety and the S atom in the spirocyclic thiophene systems control the $\sigma$(1) affinity. The main features of the pharmacophore model developed for this class of $\sigma$(1) ligands are a positive ionizable group, a H-bond acceptor group, two hydrophobic moieties, and one hydrophobic aromatic group. Docking of the ligands into a $\sigma$(1) 3D homology model via molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area calculations led to a very good correlation between the experimentally determined and estimated free energy of receptor binding. These calculations support the hypothesis of a reverse binding mode of ligands bearing the aryl moiety at the "top" (compounds 2, 3, 7, and 8) and "left" (compounds 4, 5, and 6) positions, respectively.},

abstract = {Histone modifications are known to play an important role in the regulation of transcription. While individual modifications have received much attention in genome-wide analyses, little is known about their relationships. Some authors have built Bayesian networks of modifications, however most often they have used discretized data, and relied on unrealistic assumptions such as the absence of feedback mechanisms or hidden confounding factors. Here, we propose to infer undirected networks based on partial correlations between histone modifications. Within the partial correlation framework, correlations among two variables are controlled for associations induced by the other variables. Partial correlation networks thus focus on direct associations of histone modifications. We apply this methodology to data in CD4+ cells. The resulting network is well supported by common knowledge. When pairs of modifications show a large difference between their correlation and their partial correlation, a potential confounding factor is identified and provided as explanation. Data from different cell types (IMR90, H1) is also exploited in the analysis to assess the stability of the networks. The results are remarkably similar across cell types. Based on this observation, the networks from the three cell types are integrated into a consensus network to increase robustness. The data and the results discussed in the manuscript can be found, together with code, on http://spcn.molgen.mpg.de/index.html.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In silico methods provide efficient ways to predict possible interactions between drugs and targets. Supervised learning approach, Bipartite Local Model (BLM), has recently been shown to be effective in prediction of drug-target interactions. However, for drug-candidate compounds or target-candidate proteins that currently have no known interactions available, its pure "local" model is not able to be learned and hence BLM may fail to make correct prediction when involving such kind of new candidates. RESULTS: We present a simple procedure called Neighbor-based Interaction-profile Inferring (NII) and integrate it into the existing BLM method to handle the new candidate problem. Specifically, the inferred interaction profile is treated as label information and is used for model learning of new candidates. This functionality is particularly important in practice to find targets for new drug-candidate compounds and identify targeting drugs for new target-candidate proteins. Consistent good performance of the new BLM-NII approach has been observed in the experiment for the prediction of interactions between drugs and four categories of target proteins. Especially for Nuclear Receptors, BLM-NII achieves the most significant improvement as this dataset contains many drugs/targets with no interactions in the cross validation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the NII strategy and also shows the great potential of BLM-NII for prediction of compound-protein interactions. CONTACT: jpmei@ntu.edu.sg.},

However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutations play fundamental roles in evolution by introducing diversity into genomes. Missense mutations in structural genes may become either selectively advantageous or disadvantageous to the organism by affecting protein stability and/or interfering with interactions between partners. Thus, the ability to predict the impact of mutations on protein stability and interactions is of significant value, particularly in understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic mutations on the progression of disease. Here we propose a novel approach to the study of missense mutations, called mCSM, which relies on graph-based signatures. These encode distance patterns between atoms and are used to represent the protein residue environment and to train predictive models. In order to understand the roles of mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on protein stability but also on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions.

RESULTS: We show that mCSM performs as well as or better than other methods that are used widely. mCSM signatures were successfully used in very different tasks demonstrating that the impact of a mutation can be correlated with the atomic-distance patterns surrounding an amino acid residue. We showed that mCSM can predict stability changes of a wide range of mutations occurring in the tumour suppressor protein p53, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method in a challenging disease scenario.Availability and Implementation: A web server is available at http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/mcsm CONTACT: dpires@dcc.ufmg.br and tom@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Finding geometrically similar protein binding sites is crucial for understanding protein functions and can provide valuable information for protein-protein docking and drug discovery. As the number of known protein-protein interaction structures has dramatically increased, a high-throughput and accurate protein binding site comparison method is essential. Traditional alignment-based methods can provide accurate correspondence between the binding sites but are computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this article, we present a novel method for the comparisons of protein binding sites using a 'visual words' representation (PBSword). We first extract geometric features of binding site surfaces and build a vocabulary of visual words by clustering a large set of feature descriptors. We then describe a binding site surface with a high-dimensional vector that encodes the frequency of visual words, enhanced by the spatial relationships among them. Finally, we measure the similarity of binding sites by utilizing metric space operations, which provide speedy comparisons between protein binding sites. Our experimental results show that PBSword achieves a comparable classification accuracy to an alignment-based method and improves accuracy of a feature-based method by 36{\%} on a non-redundant dataset. PBSword also exhibits a significant efficiency improvement over an alignment-based method.},

abstract = {Proteins perform functions through interacting with other molecules. However, structural details for most of the protein-ligand interactions are unknown. We present a comparative approach (COFACTOR) to recognize functional sites of protein-ligand interactions using low-resolution protein structural models, based on a global-to-local sequence and structural comparison algorithm. COFACTOR was tested on 501 proteins, which harbor 582 natural and drug-like ligand molecules. Starting from I-TASSER structure predictions, the method successfully identifies ligand-binding pocket locations for 65{\%} of apo receptors with an average distance error 2 {\AA}. The average precision of binding-residue assignments is 46{\%} and 137{\%} higher than that by FINDSITE and ConCavity. In CASP9, COFACTOR achieved a binding-site prediction precision 72{\%} and Matthews correlation coefficient 0.69 for 31 blind test proteins, which was significantly higher than all other participating methods. These data demonstrate the power of structure-based approaches to protein-ligand interaction predictions applicable for genome-wide structural and functional annotations.},

When undesired, promiscuity is a major safety concern that needs to be detected as early as possible in the drug discovery process. The analysis of large datasets reveals that the majority of promiscuous compounds are characterized by recognizable molecular properties and structural motifs, the most important one being a basic center with a pK(a)(B)>6. These compounds interact with a small set of targets such as aminergic GPCRs; some of these targets attract surprisingly high hit rates. In this review, we discuss current trends in the assessment of pharmacological promiscuity and propose strategies to enable early detection and mitigation.},

Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4[thinsp]A resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular /`mouth/' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved /`TRP domain/' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.},

abstract = {Targeted therapeutics hold tremendous promise in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. However, targeting proteins individually can be compensated for by bypass mechanisms and activation of regulatory loops. Designing optimal therapeutic combinations must therefore take into consideration the complex dynamic networks in the cell. In this study, we analyzed the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling network in the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line. We used reverse-phase protein array to measure the transient changes in the phosphorylation of proteins after IGF-1 stimulation. We developed a computational procedure that integrated mass action modeling with particle swarm optimization to train the model against the experimental data and infer the unknown model parameters. The trained model was used to predict how targeting individual signaling proteins altered the rest of the network and identify drug combinations that minimally increased phosphorylation of other proteins elsewhere in the network. Experimental testing of the modeling predictions showed that optimal drug combinations inhibited cell signaling and proliferation, whereas nonoptimal combination of inhibitors increased phosphorylation of nontargeted proteins and rescued cells from cell death. The integrative approach described here is useful for generating experimental intervention strategies that could optimize drug combinations and discover novel pharmacologic targets for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {In the search for structural models of integral-membrane metallopeptidases (MPs), we discovered three related proteins from thermophilic prokaryotes, which we grouped into a novel family called "minigluzincins." We determined the crystal structures of the zymogens of two of these (Pyrococcus abyssi proabylysin and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii projannalysin), which are soluble and, with ∼100 residues, constitute the shortest structurally characterized MPs to date. Despite relevant sequence and structural similarity, the structures revealed two unique mechanisms of latency maintenance through the C-terminal segments previously unseen in MPs as follows: intramolecular, through an extended tail, in proabylysin, and crosswise intermolecular, through a helix swap, in projannalysin. In addition, structural and sequence comparisons revealed large similarity with MPs of the gluzincin tribe such as thermolysin, leukotriene A4 hydrolase relatives, and cowrins. Noteworthy, gluzincins mostly contain a glutamate as third characteristic zinc ligand, whereas minigluzincins have a histidine. Sequence and structural similarity further allowed us to ascertain that minigluzincins are very similar to the catalytic domains of integral membrane MPs of the MEROPS database families M48 and M56, such as FACE1, HtpX, Oma1, and BlaR1/MecR1, which are provided with trans-membrane helices flanking or inserted into a minigluzincin-like catalytic domain. In a time where structural biochemistry of integral-membrane proteins in general still faces formidable challenges, the minigluzincin soluble minimal scaffold may contribute to our understanding of the working mechanisms of these membrane MPs and to the design of novel inhibitors through structure-aided rational drug design approaches.},

The approach to reduce cancer drug attrition rates must be based on three pillars.

Furthermore, clinical trials driven by tumour biology with the incorporation of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers would be beneficial in drug development. Finally, there is a need for increased collaboration to combine the unique strengths between industry, academia and regulators to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are met.},

In the post-genomic era, the decade immediately following the availability of the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, tuberculosis (TB) drug discovery relied heavily on the target-based approach but this proved unsuccessful leading to a return to whole cell screening. Genomics underpinned screening by providing knowledge and many enabling technologies, most importantly whole genome resequencing to find resistance mutations and targets, and this resulted in a selection of leads and new TB drug candidates that are reviewed here. Unexpectedly, many new targets were found to be 'promiscuous' as they were inhibited by a variety of different compounds. In the post-post-genomics era, more advanced technologies have been implemented and these include high-content screening, screening for inhibitors of latency, the use of conditional knock-down mutants for validated targets and siRNA screens.

abstract = {Microbial genome sequencing is one of the longest-standing areas of biological database development, but high-throughput, low-cost technologies have increased its throughput to an unprecedented number of new genomes per year. Several thousand microbial genomes are now available, necessitating new approaches to organizing information on gene function, phylogeny and microbial taxonomy to facilitate downstream biological interpretation. MetaRef, available at http://metaref.org, is a novel online resource systematically cataloguing a comprehensive pan-genome of all microbial clades with sequenced isolates. It organizes currently available draft and finished bacterial and archaeal genomes into quality-controlled clades, reports all core and pan gene families at multiple levels in the resulting taxonomy, and it annotates families' conservation, phylogeny and consensus functional information. MetaRef also provides a comprehensive non-redundant reference gene catalogue for metagenomic studies, including the abundance and prevalence of all gene families in the >700 shotgun metagenomic samples of the Human Microbiome Project. This constitutes a systematic mapping of clade-specific microbial functions within the healthy human microbiome across multiple body sites and can be used as reference for identifying potential functional biomarkers in disease-associate microbiomes. MetaRef provides all information both as an online browsable resource and as downloadable sequences and tabular data files that can be used for subsequent offline studies.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent group of psychiatric diseases, and have high personal and societal costs. The search for novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions is driven by the growing medical need to improve on the effectiveness and the side effect profile of existing drugs. A huge volume of data has been generated by anxiolytic drug discovery studies, which has led to the progression of numerous new molecules into clinical trials. However, the clinical outcome of these efforts has been disappointing, as promising results with novel agents in rodent studies have very rarely translated into effectiveness in humans. Here, we analyse the major trends from preclinical studies over the past 50 years conducted in the search for new drugs beyond those that target the prototypical anxiety-associated GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid)-benzodiazepine system, which have focused most intensively on the serotonin, neuropeptide, glutamate and endocannabinoid systems. We highlight various key issues that may have hampered progress in the field, and offer recommendations for how anxiolytic drug discovery can be more effective in the future.},

abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing provides the first direct information on how mutation rates vary across the human genome in somatic cells. Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature—levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3—can account for more than 40{\%} of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55{\%}. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.},

@article{Capriotti2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important source of human genome variability. Non-synonymous SNPs occurring in coding regions result in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) that may affect protein function and lead to pathology. Several methods attempt to estimate the impact of SAPs using different sources of information. Although sequence-based predictors have shown good performance, the quality of these predictions can be further improved by introducing new features derived from three-dimensional protein structures.

RESULTS: In this paper, we present a structure-based machine learning approach for predicting disease-related SAPs. We have trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a set of 3,342 disease-related mutations and 1,644 neutral polymorphisms from 784 protein chains. We use SVM input features derived from the protein's sequence, structure, and function. After dataset balancing, the structure-based method (SVM-3D) reaches an overall accuracy of 85{\%}, a correlation coefficient of 0.70, and an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. When compared with a similar sequence-based predictor, SVM-3D results in an increase of the overall accuracy and AUC by 3{\%}, and correlation coefficient by 0.06. The robustness of this improvement has been tested on different datasets and in all the cases SVM-3D performs better than previously developed methods even when compared with PolyPhen2, which explicitly considers in input protein structure information.

CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that structural information can increase the accuracy of disease-related SAPs identification. Our results also quantify the magnitude of improvement on a large dataset. This improvement is in agreement with previously observed results, where structure information enhanced the prediction of protein stability changes upon mutation. Although the structural information contained in the Protein Data Bank is limiting the application and the performance of our structure-based method, we expect that SVM-3D will result in higher accuracy when more structural date become available.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural genomics initiatives are increasingly leading to the determination of the 3D structure of target proteins whose catalytic function is not known. The aim of this work was that of developing a novel versatile tool for searching structural similarity, which allows to predict the catalytic function, if any, of these proteins.

RESULTS: The algorithm implemented by the tool is based on local structural comparison to find the largest subset of similar residues between an input protein and known functional sites. The method uses a geometric hashing approach where information related to residue pairs from the input structures is stored in a hash table and then is quickly retrieved during the comparison step. Tests on proteins belonging to different functional classes, done using the Catalytic Site Atlas entries as targets, indicate that the algorithm is able to identify the correct functional class of the input protein in the vast majority of the cases.Availability and implementation: The application was developed in Java SE 6, with a Java Swing Graphic User Interface (GUI). The system can be run locally on any operating system (OS) equipped with a suitable Java Virtual Machine, and is available at the following URL: http://www.computationalbiology.it/software/ASSISTv1.zip.

abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms. The web service is freely available at: http://chem2bio2rdf.org/slap.},

abstract = {SQ109, a 1,2-diamine related to ethambutol, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of tuberculosis, but its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SQ109 disrupts cell wall assembly, as evidenced by macromolecular incorporation assays and ultrastructural analyses. SQ109 interferes with the assembly of mycolic acids into the cell wall core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as bacilli exposed to SQ109 show immediate inhibition of trehalose dimycolate (TDM) production and fail to attach mycolates to the cell wall arabinogalactan. These effects were not due to inhibition of mycolate synthesis, since total mycolate levels were unaffected, but instead resulted in the accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), the precursor of TDM and cell wall mycolates. In vitro assays using purified enzymes showed that this was not due to inhibition of the secreted Ag85 mycolyltransferases. We were unable to achieve spontaneous generation of SQ109-resistant mutants; however, analogs of this compound that resulted in similar shutdown of TDM synthesis with concomitant TMM accumulation were used to spontaneously generate resistant mutants that were also cross-resistant to SQ109. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that these all had mutations in the essential mmpL3 gene, which encodes a transmembrane transporter. Our results suggest that MmpL3 is the target of SQ109 and that MmpL3 is a transporter of mycobacterial TMM.},

To make these data easily accessible to communities of research scientists coming from diverse horizons, we have created ChromoHub, an online resource where users can map on phylogenetic trees disease associations, protein structures, chemical inhibitors, histone substrates, chromosomal aberrations and other types of data extracted from public repositories and the published literature. The interface can be used to define the structural or chemical coverage of a protein family, highlight domain architectures, interrogate disease relevance or zoom in on specific genes for more detailed information. This open-access resource should serve as a hub for cell biologists, medicinal chemists, structural biologists and other navigators that explore the biology of chromatin signalling.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Advances in genomics technologies are providing a very large amount of data on genome-wide gene expression profiles, protein molecules and their interactions with other macromolecules and metabolites. Molecular interaction networks provide a useful way to capture this complex data and comprehend it. Networks are beginning to be used in drug discovery, in many steps of the modern discovery pipeline, with large-scale molecular networks being particularly useful for the understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss network approaches used for drug target discovery and lead identification in the drug discovery pipeline. By reconstructing networks of targets, drugs and drug candidates as well as gene expression profiles under normal and disease conditions, the paper illustrates how it is possible to find relationships between different diseases, find biomarkers, explore drug repurposing and study emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, the authors also look at networks which address particular important aspects such as off-target effects, combination-targets, mechanism of drug action and drug safety. EXPERT OPINION: The network approach represents another paradigm shift in drug discovery science. A network approach provides a fresh perspective of understanding important proteins in the context of their cellular environments, providing a rational basis for deriving useful strategies in drug design. Besides drug target identification and inferring mechanism of action, networks enable us to address new ideas that could prove to be extremely useful for new drug discovery, such as drug repositioning, drug synergy, polypharmacology and personalized medicine.},

In this context, the purpose of our study was to design and synthesize a set of 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-arylpyrazoles strictly related to rimonabant, but with the hydrazide/amide group shifted from position 3 to position 4 of the pyrazole scaffold. The synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their affinity on human CB(1) and CB(2) (cannabinoid type-2) receptors. Computational studies, performed both in the design step and after biological assays, contributed to rationalize the obtained results in terms of specific molecular interactions between antagonists and the human CB(1) receptor.},

At this time, Binding MOAD contains 5331 protein-ligand complexes comprised of 1780 unique protein families and 2630 unique ligands. We have searched the crystallography papers for all 5000+ structures and compiled binding data for 1375 (26{\%}) of the protein-ligand complexes. The binding-affinity data ranges 13 orders of magnitude. This is the largest collection of binding data reported to date in the literature. We have also addressed the issue of redundancy in the data. To create a nonredundant dataset, one protein from each of the 1780 protein families was chosen as a representative. Representatives were chosen by tightest binding, best resolution, etc. For the 1780 "best" complexes that comprise the nonredundant version of Binding MOAD, 475 (27{\%}) have binding data. This significant collection of protein-ligand complexes will be very useful in elucidating the biophysical patterns of molecular recognition and enzymatic regulation. The complexes with binding-affinity data will help in the development of improved scoring functions and structure-based drug discovery techniques.

Although durable remissions are being seen in many patients with these agents, it is becoming apparent that some patients with high genomic risk disease will relapse. Next-generation sequencing in patients as well as in vitro models is affording us the opportunity to understand the biology behind these relapses, which is the first step to designing rational therapies to prevent and treat targeted therapy-resistant CLL. These strategies are critical, as these relapses can be very difficult to manage, and a coordinated effort to put these patients on clinical trials will be required to efficiently determine the optimal therapies for these patients. In this review, we will describe mechanisms of resistance, both proven and hypothesized, for idelalisib, ibrutinib, and venetoclax, describe patterns of resistance that have been described with ibrutinib, and discuss potential strategies for management of disease resistant to these drugs as well as potential strategies to prevent resistance.},

abstract = {Drug combinatorial therapy could be more effective in treating some complex diseases than single agents due to better efficacy and reduced side effects. Although some drug combinations are being used, their underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Therefore, it is of great interest to deduce a novel drug combination by their molecular mechanisms in a robust and rigorous way. This paper attempts to predict effective drug combinations by a combined consideration of: (1) chemical interaction between drugs, (2) protein interactions between drugs' targets, and (3) target enrichment of KEGG pathways. A benchmark dataset was constructed, consisting of 121 confirmed effective combinations and 605 random combinations. Each drug combination was represented by 465 features derived from the aforementioned three properties. Some feature selection techniques, including Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance and Incremental Feature Selection, were adopted to extract the key features. Random forest model was built with its performance evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation. As a result, 55 key features providing the best prediction result were selected. These important features may help to gain insights into the mechanisms of drug combinations, and the proposed prediction model could become a useful tool for screening possible drug combinations.},

abstract = {STITCH is a database of protein-chemical interactions that integrates many sources of experimental and manually curated evidence with text-mining information and interaction predictions. Available at http://stitch.embl.de, the resulting interaction network includes 390 000 chemicals and 3.6 million proteins from 1133 organisms. Compared with the previous version, the number of high-confidence protein-chemical interactions in human has increased by 45{\%}, to 367 000. In this version, we added features for users to upload their own data to STITCH in the form of internal identifiers, chemical structures or quantitative data. For example, a user can now upload a spreadsheet with screening hits to easily check which interactions are already known. To increase the coverage of STITCH, we expanded the text mining to include full-text articles and added a prediction method based on chemical structures. We further changed our scheme for transferring interactions between species to rely on orthology rather than protein similarity. This improves the performance within protein families, where scores are now transferred only to orthologous proteins, but not to paralogous proteins. STITCH can be accessed with a web-interface, an API and downloadable files.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Currently there are no curative anticancer drugs, and drug resistance is often acquired after drug treatment. One of the reasons is that cancers are complex diseases, regulated by multiple signaling pathways and cross talks among the pathways. It is expected that drug combinations can reduce drug resistance and improve patients' outcomes. In clinical practice, the ideal and feasible drug combinations are combinations of existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs or bioactive compounds that are already used on patients or have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests. These drug combinations could directly be used on patients with less concern of toxic effects. However, there is so far no effective computational approach to search effective drug combinations from the enormous number of possibilities.

RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel systematic computational tool DRUGCOMBORANKER: to prioritize synergistic drug combinations and uncover their mechanisms of action. We first build a drug functional network based on their genomic profiles, and partition the network into numerous drug network communities by using a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization approach. As drugs within overlapping community share common mechanisms of action, we next uncover potential targets of drugs by applying a recommendation system on drug communities. We meanwhile build disease-specific signaling networks based on patients' genomic profiles and interactome data. We then identify drug combinations by searching drugs whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling modules of the disease signaling network. The novel method was evaluated on lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor positive breast cancer, and compared with other drug combination approaches. These case studies discovered a set of effective drug combinations top ranked in our prediction list, and mapped the drug targets on the disease signaling network to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug combinations.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The program is available on request.

abstract = {Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and there is an urgent need for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (Pgrmc1) protein is upregulated in multiple types of cancer, and Pgrmc1 is required for tumor cell proliferation, motility and tumor formation in vivo. Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor of Pgrmc1 suppressed the growth of lung, breast and cervical cancer cell lines. Recently, Pgrmc1 was identified as the sigma-2 receptor, a putative type of opioid receptor, and sigma-2 receptors are induced in cancers. However, Pgrmc1 shares no homology with known opioid or hormone receptors but is related to cytochrome b(5), and Pgrmc1 binds to heme and has reducing activity. In this study, we have analyzed Pgrmc1 levels in clinical tumor samples from squamous cell lung cancers (SCLC) and lung adenocarcinomas compared to corresponding nonmalignant tissue. Pgrmc1 levels increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) in 12/15 SCLC samples and was elevated in poorly differentiated tumors. Pgrmc1 was highly expressed in SCLC cell lines, and SCLC cell survival was inhibited by siRNA knockdown of Pgrmc1 or the Pgrmc1 inhibitor AG-205. In adenocarcinomas, 6/15 tumors significantly had elevated Pgrmc1 levels, which correlated with patient survival. Pgrmc1 localizes to secretory vesicles in cancer cells, and Pgrmc1 was secreted by lung cancer cells. Furthermore, Pgrmc1 was significantly elevated in the plasma of lung cancer patients compared to noncancer patients. Together, the results demonstrate that Pgrmc1 is a potential tumor and serum biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target, for lung cancer.},

The major strategy proposed for overcoming resistance is combination therapy. We present a mathematical model describing the evolutionary dynamics of lesions in response to treatment. We first studied 20 melanoma patients receiving vemurafenib. We then applied our model to an independent set of pancreatic, colorectal, and melanoma cancer patients with metastatic disease. We find that dual therapy results in long-term disease control for most patients, if there are no single mutations that cause cross-resistance to both drugs; in patients with large disease burden, triple therapy is needed. We also find that simultaneous therapy with two drugs is much more effective than sequential therapy.

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: UniChem is a freely available compound identifier mapping service on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between chemistry-based resources. In the past, the creation and maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts by each of the separate teams. These efforts were complicated by the different data models, release schedules, and differing business rules for compound normalization and identifier nomenclature that exist across the organization. UniChem, a large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these links. Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to and from all other sources are automatically calculated and immediately available for all to use. Updated mappings are immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the sources. Web services in UniChem provide users with a single simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their resource to all other sources represented in UniChem. In addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which are obsolete. Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort. Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. RESULTS: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff > -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 {\AA} for RMSD. CONCLUSION: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at . },

In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for 20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clarified data organization and cross-comparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can be conducted in an iterative manner specific to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identification of colon-specific genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug identification patterns matched to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Public resources of chemical compound are in a rapid growth both in quantity and the types of data-representation. To comprehensively understand the relationship between the intrinsic features of chemical compounds and protein targets is an essential task to evaluate potential protein-binding function for virtual drug screening. In previous studies, correlations were proposed between bioactivity profiles and target networks, especially when chemical structures were similar. With the lack of effective quantitative methods to uncover such correlation, it is demanding and necessary for us to integrate the information from multiple data sources to produce an comprehensive assessment of the similarity between small molecules, as well as quantitatively uncover the relationship between compounds and their targets by such integrated schema. RESULTS: In this study a multi-view based clustering algorithm was introduced to quantitatively integrate compound similarity from both bioactivity profiles and structural fingerprints. Firstly, a hierarchy clustering was performed with the fused similarity on 37 compounds curated from PubChem. Compared to clustering in a single view, the overall common target number within fused classes has been improved by using the integrated similarity, which indicated that the present multi-view based clustering is more efficient by successfully identifying clusters with its members sharing more number of common targets. Analysis in certain classes reveals that mutual complement of the two views for compound description helps to discover missing similar compound when only single view was applied. Then, a large-scale drug virtual screen was performed on 1267 compounds curated from Connectivity Map (CMap) dataset based on the fused similarity, which obtained a better ranking result compared to that of single-view. These comprehensive tests indicated that by combining different data representations; an improved assessment of target-specific compound similarity can be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented an efficient, extendable and quantitative computational model for integration of different compound representations, and expected to provide new clues to improve the virtual drug screening from various pharmacological properties.

While mycolic acid biosynthesis is studied extensively, components involved in mycolate transport remain unidentified. We investigated the role of large membrane proteins encoded by mmpL genes in mycolic acid transport in mycobacteria and the related corynebacteria. MmpL3 was found to be essential in mycobacteria and conditional depletion of MmpL3 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in loss of cell wall mycolylation, and of the cell wall-associated glycolipid, trehalose dimycolate. In parallel, an accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) was observed, suggesting that mycolic acids were transported as TMM. In contrast to mycobacteria, we found redundancy in the role of two mmpL genes, in Corynebacterium glutamicum; a complete loss of trehalose-associated and cell wall bound corynomycolates was observed in an NCgl0228-NCgl2769 double mutant, but not in individual single mutants. Our studies highlight the role of mmpL genes in mycolic acid metabolism and identify potential new targets for anti-TB drug development.},

abstract = {In pharmacology, it is essential to identify the molecular mechanisms of drug action in order to understand adverse side effects. These adverse side effects have been used to infer whether two drugs share a target protein. However, side-effect similarity of drugs could also be caused by their target proteins being close in a molecular network, which as such could cause similar downstream effects. In this study, we investigated the proportion of side-effect similarities that is due to targets that are close in the network compared to shared drug targets. We found that only a minor fraction of side-effect similarities (5.8 {\%}) are caused by drugs targeting proteins close in the network, compared to side-effect similarities caused by overlapping drug targets (64{\%}). Moreover, these targets that cause similar side effects are more often in a linear part of the network, having two or less interactions, than drug targets in general. Based on the examples, we gained novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of side effects associated with several drug targets. Looking forward, such analyses will be extremely useful in the process of drug development to better understand adverse side effects.},

abstract = {Biological networks are powerful tools for predicting undocumented relationships between molecules. The underlying principle is that existing interactions between molecules can be used to predict new interactions. Here we use this principle to suggest new protein-chemical interactions via the network derived from three-dimensional structures. For pairs of proteins sharing a common ligand, we use protein and chemical superimpositions combined with fast structural compatibility screens to predict whether additional compounds bound by one protein would bind the other. The method reproduces 84{\%} of complexes in a benchmark, and we make many predictions that would not be possible using conventional modeling techniques. Within 19,578 novel predicted interactions are 7,793 involving 718 drugs, including filaminast, coumarin, alitretonin and erlotinib. The growth rate of confident predictions is twice that of experimental complexes, meaning that a complete structural drug-protein repertoire will be available at least ten years earlier than by X-ray and NMR techniques alone.},

@article{Seidler2003,
abstract = {Some small molecules, often hits from screening, form aggregates in solution that inhibit many enzymes. In contrast, drugs are thought to act specifically. To investigate this assumption, 50 unrelated drugs were tested for promiscuous inhibition via aggregation. Each drug was tested against three unrelated model enzymes: beta-lactamase, chymotrypsin, and malate dehydrogenase, none of which are considered targets of these drugs. To be judged promiscuous, the drugs had to inhibit all three enzymes, do so in a time-dependent manner, be sensitive to detergent and to enzyme concentration, and form particles detectable by light scattering. Of the 50 drugs tested, 43 were nonpromiscuous by these criteria. Surprisingly, four of the drugs showed promiscuous, aggregation-based inhibition at concentrations below 100 microM: clotrimazole, benzyl benzoate, nicardipine, and delavirdine. Three other drugs also behaved as aggregation-based inhibitors, but only at high concentrations (about 400 microM). To investigate possible structure-activity relationships among promiscuous drugs, five analogues of the antifungal clotrimazole were studied. Three of these, miconazole, econazole, and sulconazole, were promiscuous but the other two, fluconazole and ketoconazole, were not. Using recursive partitioning, these experimental results were used to develop a model for predicting aggregate-based promiscuity. This model correctly classified 94{\%} of 111 compounds-47 aggregators and 64 nonaggregators-that have been studied for this effect. To evaluate the model, it was used to predict the behavior of 75 drugs not previously investigated for aggregation. Several preliminary points emerge. Most drugs are not promiscuous, even at high concentrations. Nevertheless, at high enough concentrations (20-400 microM), some drugs can aggregate and act promiscuously, suggesting that aggregation may be common among small molecules at micromolar concentrations, at least in biochemical buffers.},

abstract = {Network measures are used to predict the behavior of different systems. To be able to investigate how various structures behave and interact we need a wide range of theoretical networks to explore. Both spatial and non-spatial methods exist for generating networks but they are limited in the ability of producing wide range of network structures. We extend an earlier version of a spatial spectral network algorithm to generate a large variety of networks across almost all the theoretical spectra of the following network measures: average clustering coefficient, degree assortativity, fragmentation index, and mean degree. We compare this extended spatial spectral network-generating algorithm with a non-spatial algorithm regarding their ability to create networks with different structures and network measures. The spatial spectral network-generating algorithm can generate networks over a much broader scale than the non-spatial and other known network algorithms. To exemplify the ability to regenerate real networks, we regenerate networks with structures similar to two real Swedish swine transport networks. Results show that the spatial algorithm is an appropriate model with correlation coefficients at 0.99. This novel algorithm can even create negative assortativity and managed to achieve assortativity values that spans over almost the entire theoretical range.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm in drug discovery is the concept of designing maximally selective ligands to act on individual drug targets. However, many effective drugs act via modulation of multiple proteins rather than single targets. Advances in systems biology are revealing a phenotypic robustness and a network structure that strongly suggests that exquisitely selective compounds, compared with multitarget drugs, may exhibit lower than desired clinical efficacy. This new appreciation of the role of polypharmacology has significant implications for tackling the two major sources of attrition in drug development--efficacy and toxicity. Integrating network biology and polypharmacology holds the promise of expanding the current opportunity space for druggable targets. However, the rational design of polypharmacology faces considerable challenges in the need for new methods to validate target combinations and optimize multiple structure-activity relationships while maintaining drug-like properties. Advances in these areas are creating the foundation of the next paradigm in drug discovery: network pharmacology.},

A well-established consequence of this exposure is the evolution of multidrug-resistant pathogens, which can become virtually untreatable. Less appreciated are the concomitant changes in the human microbiome in response to these assaults and their contribution to clinical resistance problems. Studies have shown that pervasive changes to the human microbiota result from antibiotic treatment and that resistant strains can persist for years. Additionally, culture-independent functional characterization of the resistance genes from the microbiome has demonstrated a close evolutionary relationship between resistance genes in the microbiome and in pathogens. Application of these techniques and novel cultivation methods are expected to significantly expand our understanding of the interplay between antibiotics and the microbiome.},

@article{Huang2010,
abstract = {Motivation and method: Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of the catalytic domain of protein kinases have potential to become drugs devoid of (major) side effects, particularly if they bind selectively. Here, the sequences of the 518 human kinases are first mapped onto the structural alignment of 116 kinases of known three-dimensional structure. The multiple structure alignment is then used to encode the known strategies for developing selective inhibitors into a fingerprint. Finally, a network analysis is used to partition the kinases into clusters according to similarity of their fingerprints, i.e. physico-chemical characteristics of the residues responsible for selective binding.Results: For each kinase the network analysis reveals the likelihood to find selective inhibitors targeting the ATP binding site. Systematic guidelines are proposed to develop selective inhibitors. Importantly, the network analysis suggests that the tyrosine kinase EphB4 has high selectivity potential, which is consistent with the selectivity profile of two novel EphB4 inhibitors.Contact: dhuang@bioc.uzh.ch; caflisch@bioc.uzh.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The precise identification of functionally and structurally important residues of a protein is still an open problem, and state-of-the-art classifiers predict only one or at most two different categories.

RESULT: We have implemented the classifier CLIPS-4D, which predicts in a mutually exclusively manner a role in catalysis, ligand-binding or protein stability for each residue-position of a protein. Each prediction is assigned a P-value, which enables the statistical assessment and the selection of predictions with similar quality. CLIPS-4D requires as input a multiple sequence alignment and a 3D structure of one protein in PDB format. A comparison with existing methods confirmed state-of-the-art prediction quality, even though CLIPS-4D classifies more specifically than other methods. CLIPS-4D was implemented as a multiclass support vector machine, which exploits seven sequence-based and two structure-based features, each of which was shown to contribute to classification quality. The classification of ligand-binding sites profited most from the 3D features, which were the assessment of the solvent accessible surface area and the identification of surface pockets. In contrast, five additionally tested 3D features did not increase the classification performance achieved with evolutionary signals deduced from the multiple sequence alignment.

AVAILABILITY: CLIPS-4D is available as a web-service at http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying the emergence and underlying mechanisms of drug side effects is a challenging task in the drug development process. This underscores the importance of system-wide approaches for linking different scales of drug actions; namely drug-protein interactions (molecular scale) and side effects (phenotypic scale) toward side effect prediction for uncharacterized drugs.

RESULTS: We performed a large-scale analysis to extract correlated sets of targeted proteins and side effects, based on the co-occurrence of drugs in protein-binding profiles and side effect profiles, using sparse canonical correlation analysis. The analysis of 658 drugs with the two profiles for 1368 proteins and 1339 side effects led to the extraction of 80 correlated sets. Enrichment analyses using KEGG and Gene Ontology showed that most of the correlated sets were significantly enriched with proteins that are involved in the same biological pathways, even if their molecular functions are different. This allowed for a biologically relevant interpretation regarding the relationship between drug-targeted proteins and side effects. The extracted side effects can be regarded as possible phenotypic outcomes by drugs targeting the proteins that appear in the same correlated set. The proposed method is expected to be useful for predicting potential side effects of new drug candidate compounds based on their protein-binding profiles.

@article{Emery2009,
abstract = {Genetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer. For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.},

abstract = {An international consortium released the first draft sequence of the human genome 10 years ago. Although the analysis of this data has suggested the genetic underpinnings of many diseases, we have not yet been able to fully quantify the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Thus, a major current effort of the scientific community focuses on evaluating individual predispositions to specific phenotypic traits given their genetic backgrounds. Many resources aim to identify and annotate the specific genes responsible for the observed phenotypes. Some of these use intra-species genetic variability as a means for better understanding this relationship. In addition, several online resources are now dedicated to collecting single nucleotide variants and other types of variants, and annotating their functional effects and associations with phenotypic traits. This information has enabled researchers to develop bioinformatics tools to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of newly extracted variation data and to predict the effect of uncharacterized variants. In this work, we review the most important developments in the field--the databases and bioinformatics tools that will be of utmost importance in our concerted effort to interpret the human variome.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Drug repositioning is the discovery of new indications for compounds that have already been approved and used in a clinical setting. Recently, some computational approaches have been suggested to unveil new opportunities in a systematic fashion, by taking into consideration gene expression signatures or chemical features for instance. We present here a novel method based on knowledge integration using semantic technologies, to capture the functional role of approved chemical compounds. RESULTS: In order to computationally generate repositioning hypotheses, we used the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to formally define the semantics of over 20'000 terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes of action (MoA). Based on an integration of public data, we have automatically assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these MoA categories. The resulting new resource is called the Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (FTC) and was further evaluated against the content of the traditional Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC). We illustrate how the new classification can be used to generate drug repurposing hypotheses, using Alzheimers disease as a use-case.

@article{Yang2008a,
abstract = {One of the common methods for assessing energy functions of proteins is selection of native or near-native structures from decoys. This is an efficient but indirect test of the energy functions because decoy structures are typically generated either by sampling procedures or by a separate energy function. As a result, these decoys may not contain the global minimum structure that reflects the true folding accuracy of the energy functions. This paper proposes to assess energy functions by ab initio refolding of fully unfolded terminal segments with secondary structures while keeping the rest of the proteins fixed in their native conformations. Global energy minimization of these short unfolded segments, a challenging yet tractable problem, is a direct test of the energy functions. As an illustrative example, refolding terminal segments is employed to assess two closely related all-atom statistical energy functions, DFIRE (distance-scaled, finite, ideal-gas reference state) and DOPE (discrete optimized protein energy). We found that a simple sequence-position dependence contained in the DOPE energy function leads to an intrinsic bias toward the formation of helical structures. Meanwhile, a finer statistical treatment of short-range interactions yields a significant improvement in the accuracy of segment refolding by DFIRE. The updated DFIRE energy function yields success rates of 100{\%} and 67{\%}, respectively, for its ability to sample and fold fully unfolded terminal segments of 15 proteins to within 3.5 A global root-mean-squared distance from the corresponding native structures. The updated DFIRE energy function is available as DFIRE 2.0 upon request.},

However, such therapy often fails due to the evolution of acquired resistance. One long-standing question in clinical cancer research is the identification of optimum therapeutic administration strategies so that the risk of resistance is minimized. In this paper, we investigate optimal drug dosing schedules to prevent, or at least delay, the emergence of resistance. We design and analyze a stochastic mathematical model describing the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor cell population during therapy. We consider drug resistance emerging due to a single (epi)genetic alteration and calculate the probability of resistance arising during specific dosing strategies. We then optimize treatment protocols such that the risk of resistance is minimal while considering drug toxicity and side effects as constraints. Our methodology can be used to identify optimum drug administration schedules to avoid resistance conferred by one (epi)genetic alteration for any cancer and treatment type.},

@article{Kotera2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The metabolic pathway is an important biochemical reaction network involving enzymatic reactions among chemical compounds. However, it is assumed that a large number of metabolic pathways remain unknown, and many reactions are still missing even in known pathways. Therefore, the most important challenge in metabolomics is the automated de novo reconstruction of metabolic pathways, which includes the elucidation of previously unknown reactions to bridge the metabolic gaps.

RESULTS: In this article, we develop a novel method to reconstruct metabolic pathways from a large compound set in the reaction-filling framework. We define feature vectors representing the chemical transformation patterns of compound-compound pairs in enzymatic reactions using chemical fingerprints. We apply a sparsity-induced classifier to learn what we refer to as 'enzymatic-reaction likeness', i.e. whether compound pairs are possibly converted to each other by enzymatic reactions. The originality of our method lies in the search for potential reactions among many compounds at a time, in the extraction of reaction-related chemical transformation patterns and in the large-scale applicability owing to the computational efficiency. In the results, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method on the de novo reconstruction of 134 metabolic pathways in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Our comprehensively predicted reaction networks of 15 698 compounds enable us to suggest many potential pathways and to increase research productivity in metabolomics.

abstract = {An analysis of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved new molecular entities (NMEs) reveals dynamism in terms of new innovation. An assessment of the first patent for each drug shows that the pharmaceutical industry, particularly large, established companies in North America, tend to dominate the field. Over the past 10-15 years, European and Asian organizations have begun to close the gap. A dynamic inventive environment in drug discovery is suggested by the fact that NMEs for biologics or awarded to biotechnology companies often have inventors from the pharmaceutical and academic sectors. Whereas inventors continue to found biotechnology companies at a steady rate, recent trends suggest these inventors more often come from the private sector.},

abstract = {The Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform (http://protinfo.org/cando) uses similarity of compound-proteome interaction signatures to infer homology of compound/drug behavior. We constructed interaction signatures for 3733 human ingestible compounds covering 48,278 protein structures mapping to 2030 indications based on basic science methodologies to predict and analyze protein structure, function, and interactions developed by us and others. Our signature comparison and ranking approach yielded benchmarking accuracies of 12-25{\%} for 1439 indications with at least two approved compounds. We prospectively validated 49/82 'high value' predictions from nine studies covering seven indications, with comparable or better activity to existing drugs, which serve as novel repurposed therapeutics. Our approach may be generalized to compounds beyond those approved by the FDA, and can also consider mutations in protein structures to enable personalization. Our platform provides a holistic multiscale modeling framework of complex atomic, molecular, and physiological systems with broader applications in medicine and engineering.},

One method, described elsewhere, analyzes the effect of the resulting amino acid change on protein stability, utilizing structural information. The other method, introduced here, makes use of the conservation and type of residues observed at a base change position within a protein family. A machine learning technique, the support vector machine, is trained on single amino acid changes that cause monogenic disease, with a control set of amino acid changes fixed between species. Both methods are used to identify deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human population. After carefully controlling for errors, we find that approximately one quarter of known non-synonymous SNPs are deleterious by these criteria, providing a set of possible contributors to human complex disease traits.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an abundant and wide class of molecules produced by many tissues and cell types in a variety of mammals, plant and animal species. Linear alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides are among the most widespread membrane-disruptive AMPs in nature, representing a particularly successful structural arrangement in innate defense. Recently, AMPs have received increasing attention as potential therapeutic agents, owing to their broad activity spectrum and their reduced tendency to induce resistance. The introduction of non-natural amino acids will be a key requisite in order to contrast host resistance and increase compound's life. In this work, the possibility to design novel AMP sequences with non-natural amino acids was achieved through a flexible computational approach, based on chemophysical profiles of peptide sequences. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) descriptors were employed to code each peptide and train two statistical models in order to account for structural and functional properties of alpha-helical amphipathic AMPs. These models were then used as fitness functions for a multi-objective evolutional algorithm, together with a set of constraints for the design of a series of candidate AMPs. Two ab-initio natural peptides were synthesized and experimentally validated for antimicrobial activity, together with a series of control peptides. Furthermore, a well-known Cecropin-Mellitin alpha helical antimicrobial hybrid (CM18) was optimized by shortening its amino acid sequence while maintaining its activity and a peptide with non-natural amino acids was designed and tested, demonstrating the higher activity achievable with artificial residues.},

abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

The MCS search implemented in SMSD incorporates chemical knowledge (atom type match with bond sensitive and insensitive information) while searching molecular similarity. We also propose a novel method by which solutions obtained by each MCS run can be ranked using chemical filters such as stereochemistry, bond energy, etc.},

The growing corpus of literature in the field provides ample evidence to suggest the important role of lncRNAs as regulators in a wide spectrum of biological processes. Recent evidence also suggests the role of lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of disease processes. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss a conceptual framework for understanding lncRNA-mediated regulation as a function of its interaction with other biomolecules in the cell. They summarize the mechanisms of the known functions of lncRNAs in light of this conceptual framework, and suggest how this insight could help in discovering novel targets for drug discovery. They also argue how certain emerging technologies could be of immense utility, both in discovering potential therapeutic targets as well as in further therapeutic development. EXPERT OPINION: The authors propose how the field could immensely benefit from methodologies and technologies from six emerging fields in molecular and computational biology. They also suggest a futuristic area of lncRNAs design as a potential offshoot of synthetic biology, which would be an attractive field, both for discovery of targets as well as a therapeutic strategy.},

Our aim is to provide a structural perspective to the study of lipophilic efficiency and to compare molecular interactions created over evolutionary time with those designed by humans. We show that natural complexes typically engage in more polar contacts than synthetic molecules bound to proteins. The synthetic molecules also have a higher proportion of unmatched heteroatoms at the interface than the natural sets. These observations suggest that there are lessons to be learnt from Nature, which could help us to improve the characteristics of man-made molecules. In particular, it is possible to increase the density of polar contacts without increasing lipophilicity and this is best achieved early in discovery while molecules remain relatively small.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Drug repositioning is the discovery of new indications for compounds that have already been approved and used in a clinical setting. Recently, some computational approaches have been suggested to unveil new opportunities in a systematic fashion, by taking into consideration gene expression signatures or chemical features for instance. We present here a novel method based on knowledge integration using semantic technologies, to capture the functional role of approved chemical compounds. RESULTS: In order to computationally generate repositioning hypotheses, we used the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to formally define the semantics of over 20'000 terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes of action (MoA). Based on an integration of public data, we have automatically assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these MoA categories. The resulting new resource is called the Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (FTC) and was further evaluated against the content of the traditional Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC). We illustrate how the new classification can be used to generate drug repurposing hypotheses, using Alzheimers disease as a use-case.

abstract = {In order to better understand the common features present in drug molecules, we use shape description methods to analyze a database of commercially available drugs and prepare a list of common drug shapes. A useful way of organizing this structural data is to group the atoms of each drug molecule into ring, linker, framework, and side chain atoms. On the basis of the two-dimensional molecular structures (without regard to atom type, hybridization, and bond order), there are 1179 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds analyzed. However, the shapes of half of the drugs in the database are described by the 32 most frequently occurring frameworks. This suggests that the diversity of shapes in the set of known drugs is extremely low. In our second method of analysis, in which atom type, hybridization, and bond order are considered, more diversity is seen; there are 2506 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds in the database, and the most frequently occurring 42 frameworks account for only one-fourth of the drugs. We discuss the possible interpretations of these findings and the way they may be used to guide future drug discovery research.},

abstract = {The clinical success of multitargeted kinase inhibitors has stimulated efforts to identify promiscuous drugs with optimal selectivity profiles. It remains unclear to what extent such drugs can be rationally designed, particularly for combinations of targets that are structurally divergent. Here we report the systematic discovery of molecules that potently inhibit both tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases, two protein families that are among the most intensely pursued cancer drug targets. Through iterative chemical synthesis, X-ray crystallography and kinome-level biochemical profiling, we identified compounds that inhibit a spectrum of new target combinations in these two families. Crystal structures revealed that the dual selectivity of these molecules is controlled by a hydrophobic pocket conserved in both enzyme classes and accessible through a rotatable bond in the drug skeleton. We show that one compound, PP121, blocks the proliferation of tumor cells by direct inhibition of oncogenic tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases. These molecules demonstrate the feasibility of accessing a chemical space that intersects two families of oncogenes.},

abstract = {The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited by the development of drug-resistance mutations, including the gatekeeper T790M mutation. Strategies targeting EGFR T790M with irreversible inhibitors have had limited success and are associated with toxicity due to concurrent inhibition of wild-type EGFR. All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wild-type EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro. They are also effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Co-crystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of these agents. These mutant-selective irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors may be clinically more effective and better tolerated than quinazoline-based inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that functional pharmacological screens against clinically important mutant kinases represent a powerful strategy to identify new classes of mutant-selective kinase inhibitors.},

@article{Azmi2010,
abstract = {Cancer therapies that target key molecules have not fulfilled expected promises for most common malignancies. Major challenges include the incomplete understanding and validation of these targets in patients, the multiplicity and complexity of genetic and epigenetic changes in the majority of cancers, and the redundancies and cross-talk found in key signaling pathways. Collectively, the uses of single-pathway targeted approaches are not effective therapies for human malignancies. To overcome these barriers, it is important to understand the molecular cross-talk among key signaling pathways and how they may be altered by targeted agents. Innovative approaches are needed, such as understanding the global physiologic environment of target proteins and the effects of modifying them without losing key molecular details. Such strategies will aid the design of novel therapeutics and their combinations against multifaceted diseases, in which efficacious combination therapies will focus on altering multiple pathways rather than single proteins. Integrated network modeling and systems biology have emerged as powerful tools benefiting our understanding of drug mechanisms of action in real time. This review highlights the significance of the network and systems biology-based strategy and presents a proof of concept recently validated in our laboratory using the example of a combination treatment of oxaliplatin and the MDM2 inhibitor MI-219 in genetically complex and incurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is a member of a multi-protein complex that binds to progesterone and other steroids, as well as pharmaceutical compounds. In spite of its name, PGRMC1 shares homology with cytochrome b5-related proteins rather than hormone receptors, and heme binding is the sole biochemical activity of PGRMC1. PGRMC1 and its homologues regulate cholesterol synthesis by activating the P450 protein Cyp51/lanosterol demethylase, and the cholesterol synthetic pathway is an important target in cardiovascular disease and in treating infections. PGRMC1 binding partners include multiple P450 proteins, PAIR-BP1, Insig, and an uncharacterized hormone/drug-binding protein. PGRMC1 is induced in a spectrum of cancers, where it promotes cell survival and damage resistance, and PGRMC1 is also expressed in the nervous system and tissues involved in drug metabolism, cholesterol synthesis and hormone synthesis and turnover. One of the appealing features of PGRMC1 and its associated protein complex is its affinity for steroids and drugs. Together with its biological role in promoting tumor survival, PGRMC1 is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer and related malignancies.},

Similarities can be present at various levels which can be detected through comparison of protein sequences or their structural folds. In some cases similarities obscure at these levels could be present merely in the substructures at their binding sites. Inferring functional similarities between protein molecules by comparing their binding sites is still largely exploratory and not as yet a routine protocol. One of the main reasons for this is the limitation in the choice of appropriate analytical tools that can compare binding sites with high sensitivity. To benefit from the enormous amount of structural data that is being rapidly accumulated, it is essential to have high throughput tools that enable large scale binding site comparison.},

A growing number of expression data deposited in databases provide us with the raw material for screening such chimaeric transcripts and using them as the probes to identify interactions between genes in cis or in trans. Based on the high-quality chimaeric transcripts gleaned from human expression sequence tag data with selection criteria, we identified the patterns of inter- and intrachromosomal gene-gene interactions. On top the contact pattern from interchromosomal interactions, we also observed an exponential behaviour of the intrachromosomal interactions within a certain length scale, which is consistent with the independent experimental results from Hi-C screening and with the Random Loop Model. A compatible result is found for mouse. Transcription-induced chimaeric transcripts, most of which might be accidental products with trivial functions, shed light on the spatial organization of chromosomes. These inter- and intrachromosomal interactions might contribute to the compaction of chromosomes, their segregation and formation of the chromosome territories, and their spatial distribution within the nucleus.},

Here we present and validate a 'Big Bang' model, whereby tumors grow predominantly as a single expansion producing numerous intermixed subclones that are not subject to stringent selection and where both public (clonal) and most detectable private (subclonal) alterations arise early during growth. Genomic profiling of 349 individual glands from 15 colorectal tumors showed an absence of selective sweeps, uniformly high intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and subclone mixing in distant regions, as postulated by our model. We also verified the prediction that most detectable ITH originates from early private alterations and not from later clonal expansions, thus exposing the profile of the primordial tumor. Moreover, some tumors appear 'born to be bad', with subclone mixing indicative of early malignant potential. This new model provides a quantitative framework to interpret tumor growth dynamics and the origins of ITH, with important clinical implications.},

@article{Hayashi2005,
abstract = {Although originally proposed as a subtype of opioid receptors, the sigma receptor is now confirmed to be a non-opioid receptor that binds diverse classes of psychotropic drugs. Sigma receptors are subdivided into two subtypes, sigma-1 and sigma-2. The sigma-1 receptor is a 25-kDa protein possessing one putative transmembrane domain and an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Sigma-1 receptors are highly expressed in deeper laminae of the cortex, olfactory bulb, nuclei of mesencephalon, hypothalamus, and Purkinje cells in the brain. Sigma-1 receptors are predominantly localized at the endoplasmic reticulum of both neurons and oligodendrocytes. From behavioral studies, sigma-1 receptors were shown to be involved in higher-ordered brain functions including memory and drug dependence. The actions mediated by sigma-1 receptors at the cellular level can be considered either as acute or chronic. The acute actions include the modulation of ion channels (i.e., K+ channel, NMDA receptors, IP3 receptors) and the sigma-1 receptor translocation. Chronic actions of sigma-1 receptors are basically considered to be the result of an up- or down regulation of the sigma-1 receptor itself. For example, the upregulation of sigma-1 receptors per se, even without exogenous ligands, promotes cellular differentiation and reconstitution of lipid microdomains (lipid rafts) in cultured cells. These findings together suggest that sigma-1 receptors might possess a constitutive biological activity, and that sigma-1 receptor ligands might merely work as modulators of the innate activity of this protein. Recent in vitro and in vitro studies strongly point to the possibility that sigma-1 receptors participate in membrane remodeling and cellular differentiation in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Inferring the biological function of a protein from its three-dimensional structure as well as explaining why a drug may bind to various targets is of crucial importance to modern drug discovery. Here we present a generic 4833-integer vector describing druggable protein-ligand binding sites that can be applied to any protein and any binding cavity. The fingerprint registers counts of pharmacophoric triplets from the Calpha atomic coordinates of binding-site-lining residues. Starting from a customized data set of diverse protein-ligand binding site pairs, the most appropriate metric and a similarity threshold could be defined for similar binding sites. The method (FuzCav) has been used in various scenarios: (i) screening a collection of 6000 binding sites for similarity to different queries; (ii) classifying protein families (serine endopeptidases, protein kinases) by binding site diversity; (iii) discriminating adenine-binding cavities from decoys. The fingerprint generation and comparison supports ultra-high throughput (ca. 1000 measures/s), does not require prior alignment of protein binding sites, and is able to detect local similarity among subpockets. It is thus particularly well suited to the functional annotation of novel genomic structures with low sequence identity to known X-ray templates.},

@article{Vuong2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, a number of large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects have generated a large volume of somatic mutations; however, identifying the functional consequences and roles of somatic mutations in tumorigenesis remains a major challenge. Researchers have identified that protein pocket regions play critical roles in the interaction of proteins with small molecules, enzymes, and nucleic acid. As such, investigating the features of somatic mutations in protein pocket regions provides a promising approach to identifying new genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer.

METHODS: In this study, we developed a protein pocket-based computational approach to uncover the functional consequences of somatic mutations in cancer. We mapped 1.2 million somatic mutations across 36 cancer types from the COSMIC database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) onto the protein pocket regions of over 5,000 protein three-dimensional structures. We further integrated cancer cell line mutation profiles and drug pharmacological data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) onto protein pocket regions in order to identify putative biomarkers for anticancer drug responses.

RESULTS: We found that genes harboring protein pocket somatic mutations were significantly enriched in cancer driver genes. Furthermore, genes harboring pocket somatic mutations tended to be highly co-expressed in a co-expressed protein interaction network. Using a statistical framework, we identified four putative cancer genes (RWDD1, NCF1, PLEK, and VAV3), whose expression profiles were associated with overall poor survival rates in melanoma, lung, or colorectal cancer patients. Finally, genes harboring protein pocket mutations were more likely to be drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. In a case study, we illustrated that the BAX gene was associated with the sensitivity of three anticancer drugs (midostaurin, vinorelbine, and tipifarnib).

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the functional consequences of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis and for anticancer drug responses. The computational approach used might be beneficial to the study of somatic mutations in the era of cancer precision medicine.},

One of the current limitations of these data is the relative sparsity of reported interactions per protein target, and complexities in establishing clear relationships between bioactivity and targets using bioinformatics tools. We detail in this paper the indexing of targets by the structural domains that bind (or are likely to bind) the ligand within a full-length protein. Specifically, we present a simple heuristic to map small molecule binding to Pfam domains. This profiling can be applied to all proteins within a genome to give some indications of the potential pharmacological modulation and regulation of all proteins.},

abstract = {Target identification of the known bioactive compounds and novel synthetic analogs is a very important research field in medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology. It is also a challenging and costly step towards chemical biology and phenotypic screening. In silico identification of potential biological targets for chemical compounds offers an alternative avenue for the exploration of ligand-target interactions and biochemical mechanisms, as well as for investigation of drug repurposing. Computational target fishing mines biologically annotated chemical databases and then maps compound structures into chemogenomical space in order to predict the biological targets. We summarize the recent advances and applications in computational target fishing, such as chemical similarity searching, data mining/machine learning, panel docking, and the bioactivity spectral analysis for target identification. We then described in detail a new web-based target prediction tool, TargetHunter (http://www.cbligand.org/TargetHunter). This web portal implements a novel in silico target prediction algorithm, the Targets Associated with its MOst SImilar Counterparts, by exploring the largest chemogenomical databases, ChEMBL. Prediction accuracy reached 91.1{\%} from the top 3 guesses on a subset of high-potency compounds from the ChEMBL database, which outperformed a published algorithm, multiple-category models. TargetHunter also features an embedded geography tool, BioassayGeoMap, developed to allow the user easily to search for potential collaborators that can experimentally validate the predicted biological target(s) or off target(s). TargetHunter therefore provides a promising alternative to bridge the knowledge gap between biology and chemistry, and significantly boost the productivity of chemogenomics researchers for in silico drug design and discovery.},

However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75{\%} were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology.},

abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that harbor mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib. Unfortunately, all patients treated with these drugs will acquire resistance, most commonly as a result of a secondary mutation within EGFR (T790M). Because both drugs were developed to target wild-type EGFR, we hypothesized that current dosing schedules were not optimized for mutant EGFR or to prevent resistance. To investigate this further, we developed isogenic TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant pairs of cell lines that mimic the behavior of human tumors. We determined that the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant EGFR-mutant cells exhibited differential growth kinetics, with the drug-resistant cells showing slower growth. We incorporated these data into evolutionary mathematical cancer models with constraints derived from clinical data sets. This modeling predicted alternative therapeutic strategies that could prolong the clinical benefit of TKIs against EGFR-mutant NSCLCs by delaying the development of resistance.},

Structure-based target druggability assessment consists of predicting ligand-binding sites on the protein that are complementary to these drug-like properties. Automated identification of ligand-binding sites can use geometrical considerations alone or include specific physicochemical properties of the protein surface. Features of a pocket's size and shape, together with measures of its hydrophobicity, are most informative in identifying suitable drug-binding pockets.

abstract = {The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib is a new targeted therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib is given orally on a continuous schedule and induces durable remissions in the majority of CLL patients. However, a small proportion of patients initially responds to the BTKi and then develops resistance. Estimating the frequency, timing, and individual risk of developing resistance to ibrutinib, therefore, would be valuable for long-term management of patients. Computational evolutionary models, based on measured kinetic parameters of patients, allow us to approach these questions and to develop a roadmap for personalized prognosis and treatment management. Our kinetic models predict that BTKi-resistant mutants exist before initiation of ibrutinib therapy, although they only comprise a minority of the overall tumor burden. Furthermore, we can estimate the time required for resistant cells to grow to detectable levels. We predict that this can be highly variable, depending mostly on growth and death rates of the individual CLL cell clone. For a specific patient, this time can be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Our model can thus be used to predict for how long ibrutinib can suppress the disease in individual patients. Furthermore, the model can suggest whether prior debulking of the tumor with chemo-immunotherapy can prolong progression-free survival under ibrutinib. Finally, by applying the models to data that document progression during ibrutinib therapy, we estimated that resistant mutants might have a small (<2{\%}) mean fitness advantage in the absence of treatment, compared with sensitive cells.},

Each scoring function assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex, which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation data and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions. Moreover, resampling strategies, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter estimation for scoring functions.},

abstract = {Polypharmacology, which focuses on designing therapeutics to target multiple receptors, has emerged as a new paradigm in drug discovery. Polypharmacological effects are an attribute of most, if not all, drug molecules. The efficacy and toxicity of drugs, whether designed as single- or multitarget therapeutics, result from complex interactions between pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Ultimately, to predict a drug response phenotype, it is necessary to understand the change in information flow through cellular networks resulting from dynamic drug-target interactions and the impact that this has on the complete biological system. Although such is a future objective, we review recent progress and challenges in computational techniques that enable the prediction and analysis of in vitro and in vivo drug-response phenotypes.},

abstract = {The emergence and convergence of cancer genomics, targeted therapies, and network oncology have significantly expanded the landscape of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in cancer for therapeutic discovery. Extensive biological and clinical investigations have led to the identification of protein interaction hubs and nodes that are critical for the acquisition and maintenance of characteristics of cancer essential for cell transformation. Such cancer-enabling PPIs have become promising therapeutic targets. With technological advances in PPI modulator discovery and validation of PPI-targeting agents in clinical settings, targeting of PPI interfaces as an anticancer strategy has become a reality. Future research directed at genomics-based PPI target discovery, PPI interface characterization, PPI-focused chemical library design, and patient-genomic subpopulation-driven clinical studies is expected to accelerate the development of the next generation of PPI-based anticancer agents for personalized precision medicine. Here we briefly review prominent PPIs that mediate cancer-acquired properties, highlight recognized challenges and promising clinical results in targeting PPIs, and outline emerging opportunities.},

In such cases, a simpler approach based on group fusion would appear to provide superior screening performance, especially when structurally heterogeneous datasets are to be processed.},

abstract = {The design of activity landscape representations is challenging when compounds are active against multiple targets. Going beyond three or four targets, the complexity of underlying activity spaces is difficult to capture in conventional activity landscape views. Previous attempts to generate multitarget activity landscapes have predominantly utilized extensions of molecular network representations or plots of activity versus chemical similarity for pairs of active compounds. Herein, we introduce a three-dimensional multitarget activity landscape design that is based upon principles of radial coordinate visualization. Circular representations of multitarget activity and chemical reference space are combined to generate a spherical view into which compound sets are projected for interactive analysis. Interpretation of landscape content is facilitated by following three canonical views of activity, chemical, and combined activity/chemical space, respectively. These views focus on different planes of the underlying coordinate system. From the activity and combined views, compounds with well-defined target selectivity and structure-activity profile relationships can be extracted. In the activity landscape, such compounds display characteristic spatial arrangements and target activity patterns.},

For this purpose, the emerging field of chemical genomics is currently focused on accumulating large assay data sets describing compound-protein interactions (CPIs). Although new target proteins for known drugs have recently been identified through mining of CPI databases, using these resources to identify novel ligands remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that machine learning of multiple CPIs can not only assess drug polypharmacology but can also efficiently identify novel bioactive scaffold-hopping compounds. Through a machine-learning technique that uses multiple CPIs, we have successfully identified novel lead compounds for two pharmaceutically important protein families, G-protein-coupled receptors and protein kinases. These novel compounds were not identified by existing computational ligand-screening methods in comparative studies. The results of this study indicate that data derived from chemical genomics can be highly useful for exploring chemical space, and this systems biology perspective could accelerate drug discovery processes.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are challenging targets for modulation by small molecules. Here, we propose an approach that harnesses the increasing structural coverage of protein complexes to identify small molecules that may target protein interactions. Specifically, we identify ligand and protein binding sites that overlap upon alignment of homologous proteins. Of the 2,619 protein structure families observed to bind proteins, 1,028 also bind small molecules (250-1000 Da), and 197 exhibit a statistically significant (p<0.01) overlap between ligand and protein binding positions. These "bi-functional positions", which bind both ligands and proteins, are particularly enriched in tyrosine and tryptophan residues, similar to "energetic hotspots" described previously, and are significantly less conserved than mono-functional and solvent exposed positions. Homology transfer identifies ligands whose binding sites overlap at least 20{\%} of the protein interface for 35{\%} of domain-domain and 45{\%} of domain-peptide mediated interactions. The analysis recovered known small-molecule modulators of protein interactions as well as predicted new interaction targets based on the sequence similarity of ligand binding sites. We illustrate the predictive utility of the method by suggesting structural mechanisms for the effects of sanglifehrin A on HIV virion production, bepridil on the cellular entry of anthrax edema factor, and fusicoccin on vertebrate developmental pathways. The results, available at http://pibase.janelia.org, represent a comprehensive collection of structurally characterized modulators of protein interactions, and suggest that homologous structures are a useful resource for the rational design of interaction modulators.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that is capable of causing highly problematic, chronic infections in cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. With the increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant PA, the conventional "one gene, one drug, one disease" paradigm is losing effectiveness. Network pharmacology, on the other hand, may hold the promise of discovering new drug targets to treat a variety of PA infections. However, given the urgent need for novel drug target discovery, a PA protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of high accuracy and coverage, has not yet been constructed. In this study, we predicted a genome-scale PPI network of PA by integrating various genomic features of PA proteins/genes by a machine learning-based approach. A total of 54,107 interactions covering 4,181 proteins in PA were predicted. A high-confidence network combining predicted high-confidence interactions, a reference set and verified interactions that consist of 3,343 proteins and 19,416 potential interactions was further assembled and analyzed. The predicted interactome network from this study is the first large-scale PPI network in PA with significant coverage and high accuracy. Subsequent analysis, including validations based on existing small-scale PPI data and the network structure comparison with other model organisms, shows the validity of the predicted PPI network. Potential drug targets were identified and prioritized based on their essentiality and topological importance in the high-confidence network. Host-pathogen protein interactions between human and PA were further extracted and analyzed. In addition, case studies were performed on protein interactions regarding anti-sigma factor MucA, negative periplasmic alginate regulator MucB, and the transcriptional regulator RhlR. A web server to access the predicted PPI dataset is available at http://research.cchmc.org/PPIdatabase/.},

We demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of miR-1792 is responsible for these developmental abnormalities by showing that mice harboring targeted deletion of the miR-1792 cluster phenocopy several key features of the affected humans. These findings identify a regulatory function for miR-1792 in growth and skeletal development and represent the first example of an miRNA gene responsible for a syndromic developmental defect in humans.},

The issue of safety is particularly critical given how little information is available on the toxicity of some of these products. The first section uses case studies for stevia and green tea extracts as examples of how FDA evaluates the safety of botanical and herbal products submitted for consideration as Generally Recognized as Safe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (DSHEA) created a regulatory framework for dietary supplements.

abstract = {Colorectal tumours that are wild type for KRAS are often sensitive to EGFR blockade, but almost always develop resistance within several months of initiating therapy. The mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies are largely unknown. This situation is in marked contrast to that of small-molecule targeted agents, such as inhibitors of ABL, EGFR, BRAF and MEK, in which mutations in the genes encoding the protein targets render the tumours resistant to the effects of the drugs. The simplest hypothesis to account for the development of resistance to EGFR blockade is that rare cells with KRAS mutations pre-exist at low levels in tumours with ostensibly wild-type KRAS genes. Although this hypothesis would seem readily testable, there is no evidence in pre-clinical models to support it, nor is there data from patients. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected in the circulation of 28 patients receiving monotherapy with panitumumab, a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody. We found that 9 out of 24 (38{\%}) patients whose tumours were initially KRAS wild type developed detectable mutations in KRAS in their sera, three of which developed multiple different KRAS mutations. The appearance of these mutations was very consistent, generally occurring between 5 and 6 months following treatment. Mathematical modelling indicated that the mutations were present in expanded subclones before the initiation of panitumumab treatment. These results suggest that the emergence of KRAS mutations is a mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade and that these mutations can be detected in a non-invasive manner. They explain why solid tumours develop resistance to targeted therapies in a highly reproducible fashion.},

abstract = {Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1 nM to 30 $\mu$M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.},

Here, we establish a new reference state called the distance-scaled, finite ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) state. The reference state is used to construct a residue-specific all-atom potential of mean force from a database of 1011 nonhomologous (less than 30{\%} homology) protein structures with resolution less than 2 A. The new all-atom potential recognizes more native proteins from 32 multiple decoy sets, and raises an average Z-score by 1.4 units more than two previously developed, residue-specific, all-atom knowledge-based potentials. When only backbone and C(beta) atoms are used in scoring, the performance of the DFIRE-based potential, although is worse than that of the all-atom version, is comparable to those of the previously developed potentials on the all-atom level. In addition, the DFIRE-based all-atom potential provides the most accurate prediction of the stabilities of 895 mutants among three knowledge-based all-atom potentials. Comparison with several physical-based potentials is made.},

abstract = {Oligonucleotides are designed to target RNA using base pairing rules, but they can be hampered by poor cellular delivery and nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. Small molecules are preferred as lead drugs or probes but cannot be designed from sequence. Herein, we describe an approach termed Inforna that designs lead small molecules for RNA from solely sequence. Inforna was applied to all human microRNA hairpin precursors, and it identified bioactive small molecules that inhibit biogenesis by binding nuclease-processing sites (44{\%} hit rate). Among 27 lead interactions, the most avid interaction is between a benzimidazole (1) and precursor microRNA-96. Compound 1 selectively inhibits biogenesis of microRNA-96, upregulating a protein target (FOXO1) and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Apoptosis is ablated when FOXO1 mRNA expression is knocked down by an siRNA, validating compound selectivity. Markedly, microRNA profiling shows that 1 only affects microRNA-96 biogenesis and is at least as selective as an oligonucleotide.},

abstract = {Identifying driver mutations and their functional consequences is critical to our understanding of cancer. Towards this goal, and because domains are the functional units of a protein, we explored the protein domain-level landscape of cancer-type-specific somatic mutations. Specifically, we systematically examined tumor genomes from 21 cancer types to identify domains with high mutational density in specific tissues, the positions of mutational hotspots within these domains, and the functional and structural context where possible. While hotspots corresponding to specific gain-of-function mutations are expected for oncoproteins, we found that tumor suppressor proteins also exhibit strong biases toward being mutated in particular domains. Within domains, however, we observed the expected patterns of mutation, with recurrently mutated positions for oncogenes and evenly distributed mutations for tumor suppressors. For example, we identified both known and new endometrial cancer hotspots in the tyrosine kinase domain of the FGFR2 protein, one of which is also a hotspot in breast cancer, and found new two hotspots in the Immunoglobulin I-set domain in colon cancer. Thus, to prioritize cancer mutations for further functional studies aimed at more precise cancer treatments, we have systematically correlated mutations and cancer types at the protein domain level.},

To determine its mechanism of action, we identified the cellular target. Spontaneous Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis H37Rv mutants that were resistant to BM212 were isolated. By the screening of genomic libraries and by whole-genome sequencing, we found that all the characterized mutants showed mutations in the mmpL3 gene, allowing us to conclude that resistance to BM212 maps to the MmpL3 protein, a member of the MmpL (mycobacterial membrane protein, large) family. Susceptibility was unaffected by the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and verapamil. Uptake/efflux experiments with [(14)C]BM212 demonstrated that resistance is not driven by the efflux of BM212. Together, these data strongly suggest that the MmpL3 protein is the cellular target of BM212.},

Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines--which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers--with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.},

Current studies indicate that chromatin is dynamic, with its structure and its histone modifications undergoing global changes during transitions in development and in response to extracellular cues. In addition to DNA methylation and histone modification, ATP-dependent enzymes that remodel chromatin are important controllers of chromatin structure and assembly, and are major contributors to the dynamic nature of chromatin. Evidence is emerging that these chromatin-remodelling enzymes have instructive and programmatic roles during development. Particularly intriguing are the findings that specialized assemblies of ATP-dependent remodellers are essential for establishing and maintaining pluripotent and multipotent states in cells.},

After introduction of the acetaldehyde substructure (7), halogen metal exchange, addition of 1-benzylpiperidin-4-one, and cyclization led to the spirocyclic thienopyran 2a. The removal of the benzyl group afforded the secondary amine 2f, which was substituted with various residues.

The model was subjected to a 500-ps molecular dynamics simulation, and thereafter new conformers of the receptor model were produced in a simulated annealing procedure. Using an automated docking procedure, well-known cannabimimetic ligands were docked into six different model conformers, of which one was chosen for a detailed study of receptor-ligand interactions. The docking results confirm, for example, the importance of lysine K3.28(192) in the binding of these ligands. Also, other experimental data are fairly consistent with the present model, though there are some differences when compared to other recent CB1 comparison models. The present model will serve as a tool to investigate the receptor-ligand interactions and facilitate the design of novel cannabimimetic drugs.},

For this reason, mapping the targets of bioactive small molecules is a key step toward unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying their bioactivity and predicting potential side effects or cross-reactivity. Recently, large datasets of protein-small molecule interactions have become available, providing a unique source of information for the development of knowledge-based approaches to computationally identify new targets for uncharacterized molecules or secondary targets for known molecules. Here, we introduce SwissTargetPrediction, a web server to accurately predict the targets of bioactive molecules based on a combination of 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands. Predictions can be carried out in five different organisms, and mapping predictions by homology within and between different species is enabled for close paralogs and orthologs.

The resulting statistical energy function successfully refolds 13 out of 16 fully unfolded secondary-structure terminal regions of 10-23 amino acid residues in 15 small proteins. Dissecting the orientation-dependent energy function reveals that the orientation preference between hydrogen-bonded atoms is not enough to account for the structural specificity of proteins. The result has significant implications on the theoretical and experimental searches for specific interactions involved in protein folding and molecular recognition between proteins and other biologically active molecules.},

abstract = {A common underlying assumption in current drug discovery strategies is that compounds with higher in vitro potency at their target(s) have greater potential to translate into successful, low-dose therapeutics. This has led to the development of screening cascades with in vitro potency embedded as an early filter. However, this approach is beginning to be questioned, given the bias in physicochemical properties that it can introduce early in lead generation and optimization, which is due to the often diametrically opposed relationship between physicochemical parameters associated with high in vitro potency and those associated with desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics. Here, we describe analyses that probe these issues further using the ChEMBL database, which includes more than 500,000 drug discovery and marketed oral drug compounds. Key findings include: first, that oral drugs seldom possess nanomolar potency (50 nM on average); second, that many oral drugs have considerable off-target activity; and third, that in vitro potency does not correlate strongly with the therapeutic dose. These findings suggest that the perceived benefit of high in vitro potency may be negated by poorer ADMET properties.},

Here we show that the gatekeeper mutation in the cellular forms of c-ABL, c-SRC, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and -beta, and epidermal growth factor receptor activates the kinase and promotes malignant transformation of BaF3 cells. Structural analysis reveals that a network of hydrophobic interactions-the hydrophobic spine-characteristic of the active kinase conformation is stabilized by the gatekeeper substitution. Substitution of glycine for the residues constituting the spine disrupts the hydrophobic connectivity and inactivates the kinase. Furthermore, a small-molecule inhibitor that maximizes complementarity with the dismantled spine (compound 14) inhibits the gatekeeper mutation of BCR-ABL-T315I. These results demonstrate that mutation of the gatekeeper threonine is a common mechanism of activation for tyrosine kinases and provide structural insights to guide the development of next-generation inhibitors.},

abstract = {Lipid rafts are membrane platforms that spatially organize molecules for specific signaling pathways that regulate various cellular functions. Cholesterol is critical for liquid-ordered raft formation by serving as a spacer between the hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids, and alterations in the cholesterol contents of the plasma membrane causes disruption of rafts. The role that sigma receptors play in cancer is not clear, although it is frequently up-regulated in human cancer cells and tissues and sigma receptors inhibit proliferation in carcinoma and melanoma cell lines, induce apoptosis in colon and mammary carcinoma cell lines, and reduce cellular adhesion in mammary carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we provide molecular and functional evidence for the involvement of the enigmatic sigma 1 receptors in lipid raft modeling by sigma 1 receptor-mediated cholesterol alteration of lipid rafts in breast cancer cell lines. Cholesterol binds to cholesterol recognition domains in the COOH terminus of the sigma 1 receptor. This binding is blocked by sigma receptor drugs because the cholesterol-binding domains form part of the sigma receptor drug-binding site, mutations of which abolish cholesterol binding. Furthermore, we outline a hypothetical functional model to explain the myriad of biological processes, including cancer, in which these mysterious receptors are involved. The findings of this study provide a biological basis for the potential therapeutic applications of lipid raft cholesterol regulation in cancer therapy using sigma receptor drugs.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: For many analytical methods the efficiency of DNA amplification varies across the genome and between samples. The most affected genome regions tend to correlate with high C + G content, however this relationship is complex and does not explain why the direction and magnitude of effects varies considerably between samples. RESULTS: Here, we provide evidence that sequence elements that are particularly high in C + G content can remain annealed even when aggressive melting conditions are applied. In turn, this behavior creates broader 'Thermodynamically Ultra-Fastened' (TUF) regions characterized by incomplete denaturation of the two DNA strands, so reducing amplification efficiency throughout these domains. CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a mechanistic explanation for why some genome regions are particularly difficult to amplify and assay in many procedures, and importantly it also explains inter-sample variability of this behavior. That is, DNA samples of varying quality will carry more or fewer nicks and breaks, and hence their intact TUF regions will have different lengths and so be differentially affected by this amplification suppression mechanism -- with 'higher' quality DNAs being the most vulnerable. A major practical consequence of this is that inter-region and inter-sample variability can be largely overcome by employing routine fragmentation methods (e.g. sonication or restriction enzyme digestion) prior to sample amplification.},

In this paper, we develop a new method to predict potential side-effect profiles of drug candidate molecules based on their chemical structures and target protein information on a large scale. We propose several extensions of kernel regression model for multiple responses to deal with heterogeneous data sources. The originality lies in the integration of the chemical space of drug chemical structures and the biological space of drug target proteins in a unified framework. As a result, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method on the simultaneous prediction of 969 side-effects for approved drugs from their chemical substructure and target protein profiles and show that the prediction accuracy consistently improves owing to the proposed regression model and integration of chemical and biological information. We also conduct a comprehensive side-effect prediction for uncharacterized drug molecules stored in DrugBank and confirm interesting predictions using independent information sources. The proposed method is expected to be useful at many stages of the drug development process.},

Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1-8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2'-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2-8 in a near-A-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage.},

abstract = {The database of known protein three-dimensional structures can be significantly increased by the use of sequence homology, based on the following observations. (1) The database of known sequences, currently at more than 12,000 proteins, is two orders of magnitude larger than the database of known structures. (2) The currently most powerful method of predicting protein structures is model building by homology. (3) Structural homology can be inferred from the level of sequence similarity. (4) The threshold of sequence similarity sufficient for structural homology depends strongly on the length of the alignment. Here, we first quantify the relation between sequence similarity, structure similarity, and alignment length by an exhaustive survey of alignments between proteins of known structure and report a homology threshold curve as a function of alignment length. We then produce a database of homology-derived secondary structure of proteins (HSSP) by aligning to each protein of known structure all sequences deemed homologous on the basis of the threshold curve. For each known protein structure, the derived database contains the aligned sequences, secondary structure, sequence variability, and sequence profile. Tertiary structures of the aligned sequences are implied, but not modeled explicitly. The database effectively increases the number of known protein structures by a factor of five to more than 1800. The results may be useful in assessing the structural significance of matches in sequence database searches, in deriving preferences and patterns for structure prediction, in elucidating the structural role of conserved residues, and in modeling three-dimensional detail by homology.},

Our understanding of molecular events underpinning treatment failure has been enhanced by new genomic technologies and pre-clinical studies. Intratumour genetic heterogeneity (ITH) is a prominent contributor to therapeutic failure, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that individual tumours may achieve resistance via multiple routes simultaneously - termed polyclonal resistance. Efforts to target single resistance mechanisms to overcome therapeutic failure may therefore yield only limited success. Clinical studies with sequential analysis of tumour material are needed to enhance our understanding of inter-clonal functional relationships and tumour evolution during therapy, and to improve drug development strategies in cancer medicine. © 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {BMS-354825 (dasatinib) and AMN107 (nilotinib) are potent alternate Abl inhibitors with activity against many imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutants, except T315I. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells to compare incidence and types of KD mutants emerging in the presence of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, and nilotinib, alone and in dual combinations. Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E292V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F317V and T315I for dasatinib and Y253H, E255V, and T315I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T315I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents. However, sequencing uniformly revealed T315I, consistent with the need for a T315I inhibitor, to completely block resistance.},

abstract = {The rise in the number of functionally uncharacterized protein structures is increasing the demand for structure-based methods for functional annotation. Here, we describe a method for predicting the location of a binding site of a given type on a target protein structure. The method begins by constructing a scoring function, followed by a Monte Carlo optimization, to find a good scoring patch on the protein surface. The scoring function is a weighted linear combination of the z-scores of various properties of protein structure and sequence, including amino acid residue conservation, compactness, protrusion, convexity, rigidity, hydrophobicity, and charge density; the weights are calculated from a set of previously identified instances of the binding-site type on known protein structures. The scoring function can easily incorporate different types of information useful in localization, thus increasing the applicability and accuracy of the approach. To test the method, 1008 known protein structures were split into 20 different groups according to the type of the bound ligand. For nonsugar ligands, such as various nucleotides, binding sites were correctly identified in 55{\%}-73{\%} of the cases. The method is completely automated (http://salilab.org/patcher) and can be applied on a large scale in a structural genomics setting.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug effects, and for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug therapies. New methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.

RESULTS: In this article, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on genome-wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines [Connectivity Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The components can be computed with an extension of a recent approach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11 components that link the structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses observed in the three cell lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on CMap and identifies both the previously reported associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by 15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific response, resembling the effects of corticosteroids.

abstract = {We introduce a stochastic branching process model of diversity in recurrent tumors whose growth is driven by drug resistance. Here, an initially declining population can escape certain extinction via the production of mutants whose fitness is drawn at random from a mutational fitness landscape. Using a combination of analytical and computational techniques, we study the rebound growth kinetics and composition of the relapsed tumor. We find that the diversity of relapsed tumors is strongly affected by the shape of the mutational fitness distribution. Interestingly, the model exhibits a qualitative shift in behavior depending on the balance between mutation rate and initial population size. In high mutation settings, recurrence timing is a strong predictor of the diversity of the relapsed tumor, whereas in the low mutation rate regime, recurrence timing is a good predictor of tumor aggressiveness. Analysis reveals that in the high mutation regime, stochasticity in recurrence timing is driven by the random survival of small resistant populations rather than variability in production of resistance from the sensitive population, whereas the opposite is true in the low mutation rate setting. These conclusions contribute to an evolutionary understanding of the suitability of tumor size and time of recurrence as prognostic and predictive factors in cancer.},

abstract = {Human aging cannot be fully understood in terms of the constrained genetic setting. Epigenetic drift is an alternative means of explaining age-associated alterations. To address this issue, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of newborn and centenarian genomes. The centenarian DNA had a lower DNA methylation content and a reduced correlation in the methylation status of neighboring cytosine--phosphate--guanine (CpGs) throughout the genome in comparison with the more homogeneously methylated newborn DNA. The more hypomethylated CpGs observed in the centenarian DNA compared with the neonate covered all genomic compartments, such as promoters, exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions. For regulatory regions, the most hypomethylated sequences in the centenarian DNA were present mainly at CpG-poor promoters and in tissue-specific genes, whereas a greater level of DNA methylation was observed in CpG island promoters. We extended the study to a larger cohort of newborn and nonagenarian samples using a 450,000 CpG-site DNA methylation microarray that reinforced the observation of more hypomethylated DNA sequences in the advanced age group. WGBS and 450,000 analyses of middle-age individuals demonstrated DNA methylomes in the crossroad between the newborn and the nonagenarian/centenarian groups. Our study constitutes a unique DNA methylation analysis of the extreme points of human life at a single-nucleotide resolution level.},

abstract = {Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines--which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers--with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {SNPs located within the open reading frame of a gene that result in an alteration in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein [nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)] might directly or indirectly affect functionality of the protein, alone or in the interactions in a multi-protein complex, by increasing/decreasing the activity of the metabolic pathway. Understanding the functional consequences of such changes and drawing conclusions about the molecular basis of diseases, involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources including sequence, structure data and pathway relations between proteins. The data from NCBI's SNP database (dbSNP), gene and protein databases from Entrez, protein structures from the PDB and pathway information from KEGG have all been cross referenced into the StSNP web server, in an effort to provide combined integrated, reports about nsSNPs. StSNP provides 'on the fly' comparative modeling of nsSNPs with links to metabolic pathway information, along with real-time visual comparative analysis of the modeled structures using the Friend software application. The use of metabolic pathways in StSNP allows a researcher to examine possible disease-related pathways associated with a particular nsSNP(s), and link the diseases with the current available molecular structure data. The server is publicly available at http://glinka.bio.neu.edu/StSNP/.},

abstract = {Several bacterial fermentation products and their synthetic derivatives display antitumour activities and bind tightly to components of the spliceosome, which is the complex molecular machinery involved in the removal of introns from mRNA precursors in eukaryotic cells. The drugs alter gene expression, including alternative splicing, of genes that are important for cancer progression. A flurry of recent reports has revealed that genes encoding splicing factors, including the drug target splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1), are among the most highly mutated in various haematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. These observations highlight the role of splicing factors in cancer and suggest that an understanding of the molecular effects of drugs targeting these proteins could open new perspectives for studies of the spliceosome and its role in cancer progression, and for the development of novel antitumour therapies.},

When combined with prior clinical observations, these analyses suggest the following general conclusions about colorectal tumorigenesis: (i) It takes approximately 17 years for a large benign tumor to evolve into an advanced cancer but <2 years for cells within that cancer to acquire the ability to metastasize; (ii) it requires few, if any, selective events to transform a highly invasive cancer cell into one with the capacity to metastasize; (iii) the process of cell culture ex vivo does not introduce new clonal mutations into colorectal tumor cell populations; and (iv) the rates at which point mutations develop in advanced cancers are similar to those of normal cells. These results have important implications for understanding human tumor pathogenesis, particularly those associated with metastasis.},

abstract = {BioLiP (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BioLiP/) is a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand-protein interactions. Establishing interactions between protein and biologically relevant ligands is an important step toward understanding the protein functions. Most ligand-binding sites prediction methods use the protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates. However, not all ligands present in the PDB are biologically relevant, as small molecules are often used as additives for solving the protein structures. To facilitate template-based ligand-protein docking, virtual ligand screening and protein function annotations, we develop a hierarchical procedure for assessing the biological relevance of ligands present in the PDB structures, which involves a four-step biological feature filtering followed by careful manual verifications. This procedure is used for BioLiP construction. Each entry in BioLiP contains annotations on: ligand-binding residues, ligand-binding affinity, catalytic sites, Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and cross-links to the other databases. In addition, to facilitate the use of BioLiP for function annotation of uncharacterized proteins, a new consensus-based algorithm COACH is developed to predict ligand-binding sites from protein sequence or using 3D structure. The BioLiP database is updated weekly and the current release contains 204 223 entries.},

abstract = {New regulatory roles continue to emerge for both natural and engineered noncoding RNAs, many of which have specific secondary and tertiary structures essential to their function. Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.},

Most diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological disorders are complex and their pathogenesis involves multiple genetic and environmental factors. Finding a viable drug target-drug combination with high potential for yielding clinical success within the efficacy-toxicity spectrum is extremely challenging. Many examples are now available in which network-based approaches show potential for identification of novel and for repositioning targets. The objective here is to highlight network approaches for identifying novel targets with greater chances of gaining approved drugs with maximal efficacy and minimal side effects. Further enhancement of these approaches may emerge from effectively integrating computational systems biology with pharmacodynamic systems analysis. Coupling genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics databases with systems pharmacology modeling may aid in the development of disease specific networks that can be further used to build confidence in target identification.Clinical Pharmacology {\&} Therapeutics (2013); accepted article preview online 11 September 2013; doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.176.},

abstract = {Studies conducted at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) and in our laboratory show that databases including the drug sensitivities of panels of many human cancer cell lines provide valuable information on the molecular pharmacology of anticancer drugs. We established a panel of 39 cell lines of various human cancers and developed a database of their chemosensitivities. Drugs were profiled in terms of their "fingerprints", patterns of differential activity against the cell lines. There was a significant correlation between a drug's fingerprint and its mode of action, as observed in the NCI panel of 60 cell lines. Therefore our cell-line panel is a powerful tool to predict the modes of action of new compounds. We have been using this system for drug discovery, coupled with various target-based drug screenings. We used the system to identify a novel DNA minor-groove binder, MS-247, which has inhibitory activity against topoisomerases I and II, and potent in vivo antitumor activity against various human cancer xenografts. We also discovered a potent novel telomerase inhibitor, FJ5002, by mining our database with the COMPARE algorithm, followed by experimental validation. We investigated the gene expression profiles of the cell lines by using DNA microarrays to find profiles determining cellular chemosensitivity and new targets for anticancer drugs. Our integrated database, including the chemosensitivities and gene expression profiles of the cell-line panel, could provide a basis for drug discovery and personalized therapy.},

abstract = {Inspection of structure changes in proteins borne by altering their sequences brings understanding of physics, functioning and evolution of existing proteins, and helps engineer modified ones. On single amino acid substitutions, the most frequent mutation type, shifts in backbone conformation are typically small, raising doubts if and how such minor modifications could drive evolutionary divergence. Here, we report that the distribution of magnitudes of structure change on such substitutions is heavy-tailed--whereas protein structures are robust to most substitutions, changes much larger than average occur with raised odds compared to what would be expected for exponential distribution with the same mean. This nonexponential behavior allows for reconciling the apparent contradiction between the observed conservation of protein structures and the substantial evolutionary plasticity implied in their diversity. The presence of the heavy tail in the distribution promotes structure divergence, facilitating exploration of new functionality, and conformations within folds, as well as exploration of structure space for new folds.},

abstract = {The accurate identification of cavities that can bind ligands on the surface of proteins is of major importance for the characterization of the function of proteins based on its structure. In addition it can be helpful for rational structure-based drug design on target proteins of medical relevance and for evaluating the tendency of proteins to aggregate or oligomerize. A new approach termed dPredGB to detect and evaluate putative binding cavities on protein surfaces has been developed. In contrast to existing prediction methods that are based on purely geometric features of binding sites or on possible direct interactions with a putative binding partner the dPredGB approach combines rapid geometric detection with an evaluation of the desolvation properties of the putative binding pocket. It has been tested on a variety of proteins known to bind ligands in bound and unbound conformations. The approach outperforms most available methods and offers also the spatial characterization of the desolvation properties of a binding region. On a test set of proteins the method identifies in 69{\%} of the unbound cases and 85{\%} of the bound cases the known ligand binding cavity as the top ranking prediction. Possibilities to improve the prediction performance even further are also discussed.},

abstract = {For the past decade, the number of molecular targets for approved drugs has been debated. Here, we reconcile apparently contradictory previous reports into a comprehensive survey, and propose a consensus number of current drug targets for all classes of approved therapeutic drugs. One striking feature is the relatively constant historical rate of target innovation (the rate at which drugs against new targets are launched); however, the rate of developing drugs against new families is significantly lower. The recent approval of drugs that target protein kinases highlights two additional trends: an emerging realization of the importance of polypharmacology, and also the power of a gene-family-led approach in generating novel and important therapies.},

abstract = {EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance has significantly impaired the potency of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer treatment. Computational approaches can provide powerful and efficient techniques in the investigation of drug resistance. In our work, the EGFR mutation feature is characterized by the energy components of binding free energy (concerning the mutant-inhibitor complex), and we combine it with specific personal features for 168 clinical subjects to construct a personalized drug resistance prediction model. The 3D structure of an EGFR mutant is computationally predicted from its protein sequence, after which the dynamics of the bound mutant-inhibitor complex is simulated via AMBER and the binding free energy of the complex is calculated based on the dynamics. The utilization of extreme learning machines and leave-one-out cross-validation promises a successful identification of resistant subjects with high accuracy. Overall, our study demonstrates advantages in the development of personalized medicine/therapy design and innovative drug discovery.},

Ribosome structures from various species are known at the atomic level, but obtaining the structure of the human ribosome has remained a challenge; efforts to address this would be highly relevant with regard to human diseases. Here we report the near-atomic structure of the human ribosome derived from high-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and atomic model building. The structure has an average resolution of 3.6 A, reaching 2.9 A resolution in the most stable regions. It provides unprecedented insights into ribosomal RNA entities and amino acid side chains, notably of the transfer RNA binding sites and specific molecular interactions with the exit site tRNA. It reveals atomic details of the subunit interface, which is seen to remodel strongly upon rotational movements of the ribosomal subunits. Furthermore, the structure paves the way for analysing antibiotic side effects and diseases associated with deregulated protein synthesis.},

@article{Takahashi2012,
abstract = {Vertebrate genome comparisons revealed that there are highly conserved noncoding sequences (HCNSs) among a wide range of species and many of which contain regulatory elements. However, recently emerged sequences conserved in specific lineages have not been well studied. Toward this end, we identified 8,198 primate and 21,128 specific HCNSs as representative ones among mammals from human-marmoset and mouse-rat comparisons, respectively. Derived allele frequency analysis of primate-specific HCNSs showed that these HCNSs were under purifying selection, indicating that they may harbor important functions. We selected the top 1,000 largest HCNSs and compared the lineage-specific HCNS-flanking genes (LHF genes) with ultraconserved element (UCE)-flanking genes. Interestingly, the majority of LHF genes were different from UCE-flanking genes. This lineage-specific set of LHF genes was more enriched in protein-binding function. Conversely, the number of LHF genes that were also shared by UCEs was small but significantly larger than random expectation, and many of these genes were involved in anatomical development as transcriptional regulators, suggesting that certain groups of genes preferentially recruit new HCNSs in addition to old HCNSs that are conserved among vertebrates. This group of LHF genes might be involved in the various levels of lineage-specific evolution among vertebrates, mammals, primates, and rodents. If so, the emergence of HCNSs in and around these two groups of LHF genes developed lineage-specific characteristics. Our results provide new insight into lineage-specific evolution through interactions between HCNSs and their LHF genes.},
